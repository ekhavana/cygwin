Title:	Franken Archives Moved

Text:	The archives at franken.de have been moved to ftp.uni-erlangen.de<br>
      to support the increase in download traffic from the Cygwin areas.<br>
      ftp.uni-erlangen.de has a 155Mbit connection so the change should<br>
      be a good thing for all users.  Please check all your links and<br>
      make sure they reflect the new name. The upload of ported packages<br>
      is still allowed to the upload directory on ftp.franken.de as<br>
      described in my <a href="http://www.hirmke.de/software/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Hirmke_Michael/GNUWin32-contents.html#How to upload to German GNUWin32 site">package report</a>.

      binutils releases. The latest snapshot (20001216)<br>
      of Icarus Verilog fixes this problem. If you are
      one of the multitudes that had troubles, get a<br>
