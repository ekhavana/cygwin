<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC21">Why is the install of the tools failing?</A></H2>

<P>
If you are getting an error message saying "The decompression of
%s failed.  There may not be enough free disk space in the TEMP
directory.", read on.

</P>
<P>
InstallShield has a bug where it fails with this message if there
are more than a certain number of files in your TEMP directory.
You can also get this message if you have files in your TEMP dir
named the same thing InstallShield wishes to name its files (probably
from past runs of other InstallShield install scripts) which it cannot,
for some reason, write over.  Perhaps this will be fixed in a future
release of InstallShield.

</P>
<P>
Until then, clearing out your TEMP directory entirely should do it.
That will get rid of any files with conflicting names and solve the
"too many files" problem as well.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC22">Help! I haven't created /tmp and tools are behaving strangely!</A></H2>

<P>
Many Unix tools (bash, byacc, etc.) expect that /tmp always exists.
This is not guaranteed in Win32 land.  You should create /tmp or "mount"
the directory of your choice to /tmp to avoid this problem.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC23">Why does bash spew out "49054596: No such file or directory"?</A></H2>

<P>
Are you sure you created a /tmp?  The bash shell will print a
warning if it doesn't find a /tmp directory.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC24">How do I set /etc up?</A></H2>

<P>
If you want a valid /etc set up (so "ls -l" will display correct
user information for example) and if you are running NT (preferably
with an NTFS file system), you should just need to create the /etc
directory on the filesystem mounted as / and then use mkpasswd and
mkgroup to create /etc/passwd and /etc/group respectively.  Since
Windows 95/98's Win32 API is less complete, you're out of luck if
you're running Windows 95/98.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC25">Bash says that it can't vfork (or just hangs).  Why?</A></H2>

<P>
Most often this is because it can't find itself in the path.  Make sure
that your path includes the directory where bash lives, before you start
it.

</P>
<P>
Also make sure you have a valid <CODE>/bin/sh.exe</CODE>.  If you get errors
like 'no such file or directory' when you're trying to run a shell
script, which you know is there, then your problem is probably that bash
can't find <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC26">How can I get bash to read my .bashrc file on startup?</A></H2>

<P>
Your .bashrc is read from your home directory specified by the HOME
environment variable.  It uses c:\ if HOME is not set.  So you need
to set HOME correctly, or move your .bashrc to c:\.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC27">How can I get bash filename completion to be case insensitive?</A></H2>

<P>
"shopt -s nocaseglob" should do the trick.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC28">Can I use paths/filenames containing spaces in them?</A></H2>

<P>
Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths.  That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix.  If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in filenames
used by Cygwin tools.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC29">Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a directory?</A></H2>

<P>
Cygwin does not follow MS Windows Explorer Shortcuts (*.lnk
files) yet.  It sees a shortcut as a regular file and this you
cannot "cd" into it.

</P>
<P>
Some people have suggested replacing the current symbolic link scheme
with shortcuts.  The major problem with this is that .LNK files would
then be used to symlink Cygwin paths that may or may not be valid
under native Win32 non-Cygwin applications such as Explorer.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC30">I'm having basic problems with find.  Why?</A></H2>

<P>
Make sure you are using the find that came with the Cygwin tools
and that you aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead.  You
can verify that you are getting the right one by doing a "type find"
in bash.
