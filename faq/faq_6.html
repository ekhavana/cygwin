While this problem may have been worse under B19, Control-c's in bash
under Win 95 may still be able to lock up the Win 95 kernel, freezing
your machine.  This problem can be fixed if you are running the OSR2
version of Win 95 by installing the USB patch available on OSR2 CDs or
on MSDN subscription CDs.  More information about OSR2 and the USB patch
is available from <TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.compuclinic.com/osr2faq/index.html">http://www.compuclinic.com/osr2faq/index.html</a></TT>.

gcc and other tools aren't fully compatible with the current pathname
scheme: it can't grok an argument of -I//d/foo which means it is vital
that when attempting to configure/build UNIX packages, that only normal
paths with single slashes are used.
