<H1><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC31">Using Cygwin Releases</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC32">Why aren't man, groff, etc. included in the betas?</A></H2>

<P>
For obvious reasons, it isn't feasible for us to maintain and provide
binary distributions of every tool ported to work with the Cygwin
tools.  Instead I think Cygnus should concentrate its efforts on the
Cygwin library and the core development tools.  It's likely that a
man command will get added once we get it working to our satisfaction.

</P>
<P>
Other tools that have been ported should have their changes added to
the official releases so they can be compiled straight from normal
sources for that tool.  In cases where that isn't possible, someone
else (possibly Cygnus if that made sense) could maintain the diffs and
have them up for ftp.  Maybe we could keep a list of such tools on the
Cygwin Web site...

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC33">Where can I find "less"?</A></H2>

<P>
The less pager binary is available for the first time in the 20.1
release.  You will get it if you upgrade.  It is also available from
various ftp locations on the Net.  Search the mailing list archives for
the details.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC34">Where can I find "more"?</A></H2>

<P>
If you are looking for the "more" pager, you should use the "less" pager
instead.  See the last question and answer for more information.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC35">Where can I find "which"?</A></H2>

<P>
While we don't include a which command, you can use the bash built
in "type" command which does something fairly similar.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC36">How can I access other drives?</A></H2>

<P>
The best way is to use the "mount" command to mount the drive letter so
that you can refer to it with only single slashes:

</P>

<PRE>
bash$ mkdir /c
bash$ mount c:/ /c
bash$ ls /c
....
</PRE>

<P>
This is done with textual substitution whenever a file is opened.
So if you're going to do <CODE>ls /c/bar</CODE> on a mount like the above
the guts will turn that into <CODE>ls c:/bar</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that you only need to mount drives once.  The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely.
You can only get rid of them with umount (or the registry editor).

</P>
<P>
The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode where text
and binary files are treated equivalently.  This should only be
necessary for badly ported Unix programs where binary flags are missing
from open calls.

</P>
<P>
Since the beta 16 release, we also support a special means of accessing
other drive letters without using the <CODE>mount</CODE> command.  This
support may disappear in a future Cygwin release because of the
collision between this scheme and UNC pathname support (one character
machine names don't work currently).

</P>
<P>
To do an "ls" on drive letter f:, do the following:

</P>

<PRE>
bash$ ls //f/
</PRE>

<P>
Note that you can also access UNC paths in the standard way.  Because of
the drive letter shortcut mentioned above, machine names in UNC paths
must be more than one character long.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC37">How can I copy and paste into Cygwin console windows?</A></H2>

<P>
Under Windows NT, open the properties dialog of the console window.
The options contain a toggle button, named "Quick edit mode".  It must
be ON.  Save the properties.

</P>
<P>
Under Windows 9x, open the properties dialog of the console window.
Select the Misc tab.  Uncheck Fast Pasting.  Check QuickEdit.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC38">What does "mount failed: Device or resource busy" mean?</A></H2>

<P>
This usually means that you are trying to mount to a location
already in use by mount.  For example, if c: is mounted as '/'
and you try to mount d: there as well, you will get this error
message.  First "umount" the old location, then "mount" the new one and
you should have better luck.

</P>
<P>
If you are trying to umount '/' and are getting this message, you may
need to run <CODE>regedit.exe</CODE> and change the "native" key for the '/'
mount in one of the mount points kept under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Cygnus Solutions/CYGWIN.DLL setup/&#60;version&#62;
where &#60;version&#62; is the latest registry version associated with the
Cygwin library.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC39">How can I share files between Unix and Windows?</A></H2>

<P>
During development, we have both Unix boxes running Samba and
NT/Windows 95/98 machines.  We often build with cross-compilers
under Unix and copy binaries and source to the Windows system
or just toy with them directly off the Samba-mounted partition.
On dual-boot NT/Windows 9x machines, we usually use the FAT
filesystem so we can also access the files under Windows 9x.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC40">Are mixed-case filenames possible with Cygwin?</A></H2>

<P>
Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case.  A prime example
of this is perl's configuration script, which wants <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and
<CODE>makefile</CODE>.  WIN32 can't tell the difference between files with
just different case, so the configuration fails.

</P>
<P>
In releases prior to beta 16, mount had a special mixed case option
which renamed files in such a way as to allow mixed case filenames.
We chose to remove the support when we rewrote the path handling
code for beta 16.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC41">What about DOS special filenames?</A></H2>

<P>
Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either as
the root filename or as the extension part.  If you do, you'll have
trouble.  Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC42">When it hangs, how do I get it back?</A></H2>

<P>
If something goes wrong and the tools hang on you for some reason (easy
to do if you try and read a file called aux.sh), first try hitting ^C to
return to bash or the cmd prompt.

</P>
<P>
If you start up another shell, and applications don't run, it's a good
bet that the hung process is still running somewhere.  Use the Task
Manager, pview, or a similar utility to kill the process.

</P>
<P>
And, if all else fails, there's always the reset button/power switch.
This should never be necessary under Windows NT.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC43">Why the weird directory structure?</A></H2>

<P>
Why are cpp.exe, cc1.exe, etc., not in the bin directory?

</P>
<P>
Why more than one lib and include directory?

</P>

<PRE>
H-i586-cygwin32\lib\gcc-lib\...\egcs-2.91.57\include
x86-cygwin32\include
x86-cygwin32\H-i586-cygwin32\i586-cygwin32\include
</PRE>

<P>
This way multiple releases for different hosts and targets can all
coexist in the same tree.  H-i586-cygwin32 means hosted on
i586-cygwin32, common files shared by all hosts are in the top level
directories, target-specific files are in the
H-i586-cygwin32/i586-cygwin32
directory, etc...

</P>
<P>
If you had a server sharing files to a ppc NT machine and an x86 NT
machine, you could have both an H-i586-cygwin32 and an
H-powerpcle-cygwin32 directory without having to duplicate the top level
files that are the same for both hosts.  If you built and installed an
i586-cygwin32 x mips-elf cross-compiler, you would have an
H-i586-cygwin32/mips-elf with its target-specific files and some
mips-elf- prefixed binaries in H-i586-cygwin32/bin.

</P>
<P>
Normally we also have another higher level directory that identifies the
release.  Then multiple Cygwin releases can coexist with different
dll versions, giving:

</P>

<PRE>
cygnus/b19/H-i586-cygwin32
cygnus/cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32
...
</PRE>

<P>
In any case, this does add complexity to the directory structure but
it's worth it for people with more complex installations.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC44">How do anti-virus programs like Cygwin?</A></H2>

<P>
One person reported that McAfee VirusScan for NT (and others?) is
incompatible with Cygwin.  This is because it tries to scan the
newly loaded shared memory in the cygwin.dll, which can cause fork()s
to fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC45">Why can't I run bash as a shell under NT Emacs?</A></H2>

<P>
Place the following code in your startup file and try again:

</P>

<PRE>
(load "comint")
(fset 'original-comint-exec-1 (symbol-function 'comint-exec-1))
(defun comint-exec-1 (name buffer command switches)
  (let ((binary-process-input t)
        (binary-process-output nil))
    (original-comint-exec-1 name buffer command switches)))
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC46">Where did the man/info pages go?</A></H2>

<P>
In order to save space and download times, we have stopped providing
the man/info files for the tools with the binary install since we are
not yet providing a man page or info reader.  Both types of
documentation are available in a tar file available from the project ftp
site.  Or consult the online documentation over the WWW.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC47">Why can't B20's "cygcheck -s" find cpp?</A></H2>

<P>
This is a confusingly worded warning that will be reworded in future
versions.  In fact, cygcheck should normally *not* find cpp; if it does,
it may be a problem (e.g. it might pick up Borland's cpp, which would
cause problems).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC48">Why do I get a message saying Out of Queue slots?</A></H2>

<P>
"Out of queue slots!" generally occurs when you're trying to remove
many files that you do not have permission to remove (either because
you don't have permission, they are opened exclusively, etc).  What
happens is Cygwin queues up these files with the supposition that it
will be possible to delete these files in the future.  Assuming that
the permission of an affected file does change later on, the file will
be deleted as requested.  However, if too many requests come in to
delete inaccessible files, the queue overflows and you get the message
you're asking about.  Usually you can remedy this with a quick chmod,
close of a file, or other such thing.  (Thanks to Larry Hall for
this explanation).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC49">Why don't symlinks work on samba-mounted filesystems?</A></H2>

<P>
Mumit Khan writes (edited):

</P>
<P>
Cygwin implements the symbolic links by adding a magic cookie to the
file and then setting the SYSTEM attribute (this is just for
efficiency). Samba servers support this SYSTEM attribute by setting
the group execute bit on a file, so it does support the symbolic links
already. Unfortunately, the reason you don't see it is because it's
turned OFF by default.

</P>
<P>
If you need to have symbolic support in the server, you can turn it on
by the following in the Samba configuration file and then restarting
it:

</P>

<PRE>
   mask system = yes 
   create mask = 0775
</PRE>

<P>
the "create mask" can be anything as long as you *DON'T* mask out the
group execute bit (ie., 010), which is what Samba server uses to
support the SYSTEM attribute.

</P>
<P>
Please consult your SAMBA docs before doing anything. I don't know how
far back this support goes, but I remember it back in 1.9.x days.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC50">Why does df report sizes incorrectly.</A></H2>

<P>
There is a bug in the Win32 API function GetFreeDiskSpace that
makes it return incorrect values for disks larger than 2 GB in size.
Perhaps that may be your problem?

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC51">Has the screen program been ported yet?</A></H2>

<P>
Screen requires either unix domain sockets or fifoes.  Neither of
them have been implemented in Cygwin yet.
