<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="faq.html#TOC1">What is it?</A></H1>

<P>
The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools for
Microsoft Windows.  They run thanks to the Cygwin library which
provides the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect.


<P>
With these tools installed, it is possible to write Win32 console or
GUI applications that make use of the standard Microsoft Win32 API
and/or the Cygwin API.  As a result, it is possible to easily
port many significant Unix programs without the need
for extensive changes to the source code.  This includes configuring
and building most of the available GNU software (including the packages
included with the Cygwin development tools themselves).  Even if
the development tools are of little to no use to you, you may have
interest in the many standard Unix utilities provided with the package.
They can be used both from the bash shell (provided) or from the
standard Windows command shell.




<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="faq.html#TOC2">What versions of Windows are supported?</A></H2>

<P>
Wait a minute... Cygwin is only <EM>supported</EM> if you are paying for
it, such as through a support contract with Red Hat.  For information
about getting a Red Hat support contract, see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/</A></STRONG>.


<P>
That said, Cygwin can be expected to run on all modern 32 bit versions of
Windows, except Windows CE.  This includes Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP.


<P>
Keep in mind that Cygwin can only do as much as the underlying OS
supports.  Because of this, Cygwin will behave differently, and
exhibit different limitations, on the various versions of Windows.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="faq.html#TOC3">Where can I get it?</A></H2>

<P>
The home page for the Cygwin project is <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A></STRONG>.
There you should find everything you need for Cygwin, including links
for download and setup, a current list of mirror sites, a User's
Guide, an API Reference, mailing lists and archives, and additional
ported software.


<P>
You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/manual/">http://www.fsf.org/manual/</A></STRONG>.  (You should read GNU manuals from a
local mirror.  Check <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html">http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html</A></STRONG>
for a list of them.)




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="faq.html#TOC4">Is it free software?</A></H2>

<P>
Yes.  Parts are GNU software (gcc, gas, ld, etc...), parts are covered
by the standard X11 license, some of it is public domain, some of
it was written by Cygnus and placed under the GPL.  None of it is
shareware.  You don't have to pay anyone to use it but you should be
sure to read the copyright section of the FAQ for more information on
how the GNU General Public License may affect your use of these tools.


<P>
In particular, if you intend to port a proprietary (non-GPL'd)
application using Cygwin, you will need the proprietary-use license 
for the Cygwin library.  This is available for purchase; please visit
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/</A></STRONG> for more information.
All other questions should be sent to the project
mailing list <A HREF="mailto:cygwin@cygwin.com">cygwin@cygwin.com</A>.


<P>
Note that when we say "free" we mean freedom, not price.  The goal of
such freedom is that the people who use a given piece of software
should be able to change it to fit their needs, learn from it, share
it with their friends, etc.  The Cygwin license allows you those
freedoms, so it is free software.




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="faq.html#TOC5">What version of Cygwin <EM>is</EM> this, anyway?</A></H2>

<P>
To find the version of the Cygwin DLL installed, you can use
<TT>`uname'</TT> as on Linux or <TT>`cygcheck'</TT>. Refer to each command's
<SAMP>`--help'</SAMP> output and the <A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/">Cygwin User's Guide</A> for more information.


<P>
If you are looking for the version number for the whole Cygwin
release, there is none. Each package in the Cygwin release has its own
version.  The packages in Cygwin are continually improving, thanks to
the efforts of net volunteers who maintain the Cygwin binary ports.
Each package has its own version numbers and its own release process.


<P>
So, how do you get the most up-to-date version of Cygwin?  Easy.  Just
download the Cygwin Setup program from
<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">http://cygwin.com/setup.exe</A>.  This program will handle the task
of updating the packages on your system to the latest version. For
more information about using Cygwin's <TT>`setup.exe'</TT>, see 
<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html">Setting Up Cygwin</A>
in the Cygwin User's Guide. 


<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="faq.html#TOC6">Installation Instructions</A></H1>


<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="faq.html#TOC7">Contents</A></H2>

<P>
There is only one recommended way to install Cygwin, which is to use the GUI
installer "Cygwin Setup".  It is flexible and easy to use.  
You can pick and choose the packages you wish to install, and update
them individually.  Full source code is available for all packages and
tools.  More information on using Cygwin Setup may be found at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html</A></STRONG>.


<P>
If you do it any other way, you're on your own!  That said, keep in mind
that the GUI installer is a "work in progress", so there might be a few
difficulties, especially if you are behind a firewall or have other
specific requirements.  If something doesn't work right for you, and
it's not covered here or in the latest development snapshot at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup/">http://cygwin.com/setup/</A></STRONG>, then by all means report it to the
mailing list.


<P>
For a searchable list of packages that can be installed with Cygwin,
see <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/">http://cygwin.com/packages/</A></STRONG>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="faq.html#TOC8">Installation using "Cygwin Setup"</A></H2>

<P>
The Cygwin Setup program is the <EM>only</EM> recommended way to install
Cygwin. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="faq.html#TOC9">Why not install in C:\?</A></H3>

<P>
The Cygwin Setup program will prompt you for a "root" directory.
The default is <SAMP>`C:\cygwin'</SAMP>, but you can change it.  You are urged not to
choose something like <SAMP>`C:\'</SAMP> (the root directory on the system drive) for
your Cygwin root.  If you do, then critical Cygwin system directories
like <SAMP>`etc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`bin'</SAMP> could easily be corrupted by
other (non-Cygwin) applications or packages that use <SAMP>`\etc'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`\lib'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`\bin'</SAMP>.  Perhaps there is no conflict now, but who
knows what you might install in the future?  It's also just good common
sense to segregate your Cygwin "filesystems" from the rest of your
Windows system disk.


<P>
(In the past, there had been genuine bugs that would cause problems
for people who installed in <SAMP>`C:\'</SAMP>, but we believe those are gone
now.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="faq.html#TOC10">Can I use Cygwin Setup to get old versions of packages (like gcc-2.95)?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin Setup can be used to install any packages that are on a
Cygwin mirror, which usually includes one version previous to the
current one. The complete list may be searched at 
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/">http://cygwin.com/packages/</A></STRONG>.  There is no complete archive of
older packages. If you have a problem with the current version of
a Cygwin package, please report it to the mailing list using the 
guidelines at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/problems.html">http://cygwin.com/problems.html</A></STRONG>.


<P>
That said, if you really need an older package, you may be able to find
an outdated or archival mirror by searching the web for an old package
version (for example, <SAMP>`gcc2-2.95.3-10-src.tar.bz2'</SAMP>), but keep in
mind that this older version will not be supported by the mailing list
and that installing the older version will not help improve Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="faq.html#TOC11">Is Cygwin Setup, or one of the packages, infected with a virus?</A></H3>

<P>
Unlikely.  Unless you can confirm it, please don't report it to the
mailing list.  Anti-virus products have been known to detect false
positives when extracting compressed tar archives.  If this causes
problems for you, consider disabling your anti-virus software when
running <CODE>setup</CODE>.  Read the next entry for a fairly safe way to do
this.




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="faq.html#TOC12">My computer hangs when I run Cygwin Setup!</A></H3>

<P>
Both Network Associates (formerly McAfee) and Norton anti-virus
products have been reported to "hang" when extracting Cygwin tar
archives.  If this happens to you, consider disabling your anti-virus
software when running Cygwin Setup.  The following procedure should be
a fairly safe way to do that:



<OL>
<LI>Download <CODE>setup.exe</CODE> and scan it explicitly.

<LI>Turn off the anti-virus software.

<LI>Run setup to download and extract all the tar files.

<LI>Re-activate your anti-virus software and scan everything

This should be safe, but only if Cygwin Setup is not substituted by
something malicious, and no mirror has been compromised.




<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="faq.html#TOC13">What packages should I download? Where are 'make', 'gcc', 'vi', etc?</A></H3>
<P>
When using Cygwin Setup for the first time, the default is to install
a minimal subset of packages.  If you want anything beyond that, you
will have to select it explicitly.  See
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/">http://cygwin.com/packages/</A></STRONG> for a searchable list of available
packages.


<P>
If you want to build programs, of course you'll need <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`binutils'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> and probably other packages from the
"Devel" category. Text editors can be found under "Editors".




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="faq.html#TOC14">How do I just get everything?</A></H3>

<P>
Long ago, the default was to install everything, much to the
irritation of most users.  Now the default is to install only a basic
core of packages.  Cygwin Setup is designed to make it easy to browse
categories and select what you want to install or omit from those
categories.  It's also easy to install everything:



<OL>

<LI>At the "Select Packages" screen, in "Categories" view, at the line

marked "All", click on the word "default" so that it changes to
"install".  (Be patient, there is some computing to do at this step.
It may take a second or two to register the change.)  This tells Setup
to install <EM>everything</EM>, not just what it thinks you should have
by default.

<LI>Now click on the "View" button (twice) until you get the

"Partial" view.  This shows exactly which packages are about to be
downloaded and installed.

</OL>

<P>
This procedure only works for packages that are currently available.
There is no way to tell Cygwin Setup to install all packages by
default from now on.  As new packages become available that would not
be installed by default, you have to repeat the above procedure to get
them.


<P>
In general, a better method (in my opinion), is to:



<OL>

<LI>First download &#38; install all packages that would normally be

installed by default.  This includes fundamental packages and any
updates to what you have already installed.  Then...

<LI>Run Cygwin Setup again, and apply the above technique to get all

new packages that would not be installed by default.  You can check
the list in the Partial View before proceeding, in case there's
something you really <EM>don't</EM> want.

<LI>In the latest version of Cygwin Setup, if you click the "View"

button (twice) more, it shows packages not currently installed.  You
ought to check whether you <EM>really</EM> want to install everything!

</OL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="faq.html#TOC15">How much disk space does Cygwin require?</A></H3>

<P>
That depends, obviously, on what you've chosen to download and
install.  A full installation today is probably larger than 800MB
installed, not including the package archives themselves nor the source
code.


<P>
After installation, the package archives remain in your "Local
Package Directory", by default the location of <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.  You
may conserve disk space by deleting the subdirectories there.  These
directories will have very weird looking names, being encoded with
their URLs.




<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="faq.html#TOC16">What if setup fails?</A></H3>

<P>
First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Cygwin
Setup.  The latest version is always available from the 'Install
Cygwin now' link on the Cygwin Home Page at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A></STRONG>.


<P>
If you are downloading from the Internet, setup will fail if it cannot
download the list of mirrors at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html">http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html</A></STRONG>.  It could be that
the network is too busy.  Something similar could be the cause of a
download site not working.  Try another mirror, or try again later.


<P>
If setup refuses to download a package that you know needs to be
upgraded, try deleting that package's entry from /etc/setup.  If you are
reacting quickly to an announcement on the mailing list, it could be
that the mirror you are using doesn't have the latest copy yet.  Try
another mirror, or try again tomorrow.


<P>
If setup has otherwise behaved strangely, check the files
<SAMP>`setup.log'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`setup.log.full'</SAMP> in <CODE>/var/log</CODE>
(<CODE>C:\cygwin\var\log</CODE> by default).  It may provide some clues as
to what went wrong and why.


<P>
If you're still baffled, search the Cygwin mailing list for clues.
Others may have the same problem, and a solution may be posted there.
If that search proves fruitless, send a query to the Cygwin mailing
list.  You must provide complete details in your query: version of
setup, options you selected, contents of setup.log and setup.log.full,
what happened that wasn't supposed to happen, etc.




<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="faq.html#TOC17">My Windows logon name has a space in it, will this cause problems?</A></H3>

<P>
Most definitely yes!  UNIX shells (and thus Cygwin) use the space
character as a word delimiter.  Under certain circumstances, it is
possible to get around this with various shell quoting mechanisms, but
you are much better off if you can avoid the problem entirely.


<P>
On Windows NT/2000/XP you have two choices:

<OL>

<LI>You can rename the user in the Windows User Manager GUI and then

run mkpasswd.

<LI>You can simply edit the /etc/passwd file and change the Cygwin user name

(first field). It's also a good idea to avoid spaces in the home directory.

</OL>

<P>
On Windows 95/98/ME you can create a new user and run mkpasswd, 
or you can delete the offending entry from /etc/passwd. 
Cygwin will then use the name in the default entry with uid 500.




<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="faq.html#TOC18">My <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> environment variable is not what I want.</A></H3>

<P>
When starting Cygwin from Windows, <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> is determined as follows
in order of decreasing priority:



<OL>

<LI><SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> from the Windows environment, translated to POSIX form.

<LI>The entry in /etc/passwd

<LI><SAMP>`HOMEDRIVE'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`HOMEPATH'</SAMP> from the Windows environment

<LI>/

</OL>

<P>
When using Cygwin from the network (telnet, ssh,...), <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> is set 
from /etc/passwd.


<P>
If your <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> is set to a value such as /cygdrive/c, it is likely 
that it was set in Windows. Start a DOS Command Window and type 
"set HOME" to verify if this is the case.


<P>
Access to shared drives is often restricted when starting from the network,
thus Domain users may wish to have a different <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> in the 
Windows environment (on shared drive) than in /etc/passwd (on local drive).
Note that ssh only considers /etc/passwd, disregarding <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP>. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="faq.html#TOC19">How do I uninstall individual packages?</A></H3>

<P>
Run Cygwin Setup as you would to install packages.  In the list of
packages to install, browse the relevant category or click on the

the action reads "Uninstall".  Proceed by clicking "Next".




<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="faq.html#TOC20">How do I uninstall <STRONG>all</STRONG> of Cygwin?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="faq.html#TOC21">How do I install snapshots?</A></H3>

<P>
First, are you sure you want to do this?  Snapshots are risky.  They
have not been tested.  Use them <STRONG>only</STRONG> if there is a feature or
bugfix that you need to try, and you are willing to deal with any
problems.


<P>
Before installing a snapshot, you must first Close <STRONG>all</STRONG> Cygwin
applications, including shells and services (e.g. inetd, sshd), before
updating <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE>.  You may have to restart Windows to clear
the DLL from memory.


<P>
You cannot use Setup to install a snapshot.


<P>
You should generally install the full
<CODE>cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2</CODE> update, rather than just the DLL,
otherwise some components may be out of sync.  Cygwin tar won't be
able to update <CODE>/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll</CODE>, but it should succeed with

While some users have successfully done this, for example Indiana

<P>
If you have installed Cygwin, you can find lots of documentation in
<SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/'</SAMP>.  Many packages ship with standard documentation,
which you can find in <SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/<EM>package_name</EM>'</SAMP> or by
using the <CODE>man</CODE> or <CODE>info</CODE> tools. (Hint: use <CODE>cygcheck
-l <EM>package_name</EM></CODE> to list what man pages the package includes.)
In addition, some packages have Cygwin specific instructions in a file
<SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/<EM>package_name</EM>.README'</SAMP>.  Some older
packages still keep their documentation in <SAMP>`/usr/doc/'</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/'</SAMP>.


<P>
There are links to quite a lot of documentation on the main Cygwin

<P>
If you upgraded recently, and suddenly vim (or some other Cygwin

repair the damage, you must run Cygwin Setup again, and re-install the
<SAMP>`libncurses5'</SAMP> package.


<P>
Note that Cygwin Setup won't show this option by default.  In the
"Select packages to install" dialog, click on the <SAMP>`Full/Part'</SAMP>

<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="faq.html#TOC32">Why is Cygwin suddenly <EM>so</EM> slow?</A></H3>

<P>
If you recently upgraded and suddenly <EM>every</EM> command takes a
<EM>very</EM> long time, then something is probably attempting to 
access a network share.  You may have the obsolete <CODE>//c</CODE>
notation in your PATH or startup files.  This now means the

tremendously if it does not exist.  


<P>
Using //c (for C:) doesn't work anymore.  (Similarly for any drive
letter, e.g. <CODE>//z</CODE> for <CODE>Z:</CODE>) This "feature" has long been
deprecated, and no longer works at all in the latest release.  As of
release 1.3.3, <CODE>//c</CODE> now means the <EM>network share</EM> <CODE>c</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="faq.html#TOC33">Why don't my services work (or access network shares)?</A></H3>

<P>
Most Windows services run as a special user called <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP>.  If you
installed Cygwin for "Just Me", the <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP> user won't see your
Cygwin mount table.  You need to re-mount all of your mounts as
"system" for services to work. You can re-run <SAMP>`setup.exe'</SAMP> and
select "Install for All Users", or this script will do the trick:



<PRE>
eval "`mount -m | sed -e 's/ -u / -s /g' -e 's/$/;/'`"
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP> user cannot access network shares that require
authentication.  For more information, see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html</A></STRONG>.


<P>
Workarounds include using public network share that does not require

your own user with <SAMP>`cygrunsrv -u'</SAMP> (see 
<SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/cygrunsrv.README'</SAMP> for more information).




<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="faq.html#TOC34">How should I set my PATH?</A></H3>

<P>
This is done for you in the file /etc/profile, which is sourced by bash
when you start it from the Desktop or Start Menu shortcut, created by
<CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.  The line is



<PRE>
	PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"
</PRE>

<P>
Effectively, this <STRONG>prepends</STRONG> /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin to your
Windows system path.  If you choose to reset your PATH, say in
$HOME/.bashrc, or by editing etc/profile directly, then you should
follow this rule.  You <STRONG>must</STRONG> have <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> in your PATH
<STRONG>before</STRONG> any Windows system directories.  (And you must not omit
the Windows system directories!)  Otherwise you will likely encounter
all sorts of problems running Cygwin applications.




<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="faq.html#TOC35">Bash says "command not found", but it's right there!</A></H3>

If you compile a program, you might find that you can't run it:



<PRE>
	bash$ gcc -o hello hello.c
        bash$ hello
        bash: hello: command not found
</PRE>

<P>
Unlike Windows, bash does not look for programs in <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> (the current

but this is not recommended (at least on UNIX) for security reasons.
Just tell bash where to find it, when you type it on the command line:

</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="faq.html#TOC36">How do I convert between Windows and UNIX paths?</A></H3>

as such.




<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="faq.html#TOC37">Why doesn't bash read my .bashrc file on startup?</A></H3>

<P>
Your .bashrc is read from your home directory specified by the HOME

<H3><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="faq.html#TOC39">Can I use paths/filenames containing spaces in them?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths.  That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix.  If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in filenames
used by Cygwin tools.


<P>
In particular, bash interprets space as a word separator.  You would have
to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space character.
For example:

<PRE>
	bash-2.03$ cd '/cygdrive/c/Program Files'
</PRE>

<P>
or

<PRE>
	bash-2.03$ cd /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="faq.html#TOC40">Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a directory?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin versions &#60; 1.3.0 do not follow MS Windows Explorer Shortcuts
(*.lnk files).  It sees a shortcut as a regular file and this you
cannot "cd" into it.


<P>
Since version 1.3.0, Cygwin uses shortcuts as symlinks by default.


<P>
Cygwin shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native Windows
applications.  Windows applications can usually make use of Cygwin
shortcuts but not vice versa.  This is by choice.  The reason is that
Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which would
get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts them as
symlinks.


<P>
Changing a Cygwin shortcut in Windows Explorer usually changes a Cygwin
shortcut into a Windows native shortcut.  Afterwards, Cygwin will not
recognize it as symlink anymore.




<H3><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="faq.html#TOC41">I'm having basic problems with find.  Why?</A></H3>

<P>
Make sure you are using the find that came with Cygwin and that you
aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead.  You can verify that
you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.


<P>
If the path argument to find, including current directory (default), is
itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it unless you
specify the <SAMP>`-follow'</SAMP> option.  This behavior is different than most
other UNIX implementations, but is not likely to change.


<P>
If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to be
missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem with one
of find's optimisations.  The absence of <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`..'</SAMP>
directories on some filesystems, such as DVD-R UDF, can confuse find.
See the documentation for the option <SAMP>`-noleaf'</SAMP> in the man page.

<P>
<SAMP>`ntea'</SAMP> works on NTFS <EM>and</EM> FAT but it creates a huge,

<P>
(The <SAMP>`ntsec'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`ntea'</SAMP> settings are values for the

<P>
There is no solution at all for Windows 9x.


<P>
If you have an application that requires a certain permission mode on a

Vinschen for OpenSSH, see this message from the cygwin mailing list:

<H3><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="faq.html#TOC45">Why doesn't <SAMP>`mkdir -p'</SAMP> work on a network share?</A></H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, you cannot do something like this:



<PRE>
bash$ mkdir -p //MACHINE/Share/path/to/new/dir
mkdir: cannot create directory `//MACHINE': No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
This is because mkdir checks for the existence of each directory on the
path, creating them as necessary.  Since <SAMP>`//MACHINE'</SAMP> is not a
directory (you can't cd to it either), mkdir tries to create it, and
fails.


<P>
This might get fixed someday, but for now, you have to work around it:



<PRE>
bash$ cd //MACHINE/Share
bash$ mkdir -p path/to/new/dir
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="faq.html#TOC46">Why doesn't my shell script work?</A></H3>

<P>
There are two basic problems you might run into.  One is the fact that
/bin/sh is really ash, and is missing some features you might expect
in /bin/sh, particularly if you are used to /bin/sh actually being
bash (Linux) or ksh (Tru64).  For example:



<UL>
<LI>No `~' expansion (use $HOME instead)

<LI>No job control

<LI>No getopts

<LI>No let

<LI>No functions exported

<LI>Must use `.' instead of `source' (true of sh and ksh too, not just ash)

</UL>

<P>
Or, it could be a permission problem, and Cygwin doesn't understand that
your script is executable.  Because <SAMP>`chmod'</SAMP> may not work (see FAQ
entry above), Cygwin must read the contents of files to determine if
they are executable.  If your script does not start with



<PRE>
	#! /bin/sh
</PRE>

<P>
(or any path to a script interpreter, it does not have to be /bin/sh)
then Cygwin will not know it is an executable script.  The Bourne shell
idiom



<PRE>
	:
	# This is the 2nd line, assume processing by /bin/sh
</PRE>

<P>
also works.


<P>
Note that you can use <SAMP>`mount -x'</SAMP> to force Cygwin to treat all files
under the mount point as executable.  This can be used for individual
files as well as directories.  Then Cygwin will not bother to read files
to determine whether they are executable.




<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="faq.html#TOC47">How do I print under Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
There is no working lp or lpr system as you would find on UNIX.


<P>
Jason Tishler has written a couple of messages that explain how to use
a2ps (for nicely formatted text in PostScript) and ghostscript (to print
PostScript files on non-PostScript Windows printers).  Start at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2001-04/msg00657.html">http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2001-04/msg00657.html</A></STRONG>.  Note that the
<SAMP>`file'</SAMP> command is now available as part of Cygwin setup.


<P>
Alternatively, on NT, you can use the Windows <SAMP>`print'</SAMP> command.  (It
does not seem to be available on Win9x.)  Type



<PRE>
	bash$ print /\?

<P>
Finally, you can simply <SAMP>`cat'</SAMP> the file to the printer's share name:



<PRE>
	bash$ cat myfile &#62; //host/printer

<P>
You may need to press the formfeed button on your printer or append the

<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="faq.html#TOC48">Why don't international (Unicode) characters work?</A></H3>

<P>
Internationalization is a complex issue. The short answer is that
Cygwin is not Unicode-aware, so things that might work in Linux will
not necessarily work on Cygwin. However, some things do work. To type
international characters () in <CODE>bash</CODE>, add the following
lines to your <CODE>~/.inputrc</CODE> file and restart <CODE>bash</CODE>:



<PRE>

        set output-meta on 
	set input-meta on

	set meta-flag on
</PRE>

<P>
These are options to the <CODE>readline</CODE> library, which you can read
about in the <CODE>bash(1)</CODE> and <CODE>readline(3)</CODE> man pages. Other
tools that do not use <CODE>readline</CODE> for display, such as <CODE>less</CODE>

These examples use the Japanese Shift-JIS character set, obviously
you will want to change them for your own locale. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="faq.html#TOC49">Why don't cursor keys work under Win95/Win98?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
Careful examination shows that they not just non-functional, but
rather behave strangely, for example, with NumLock off, keys on numeric
keyboard work, until you press usual cursor keys, when even numeric
stop working, but they start working again after hitting alphanumeric
key, etc. This reported to happen on localized versions of Win98 and
Win95, and not specific to Cygwin; there are known cases of Alt+Enter
(fullscreen/windowed toggle) not working and shifts sticking with
other programs. The cause of this problem is Microsoft keyboard
localizer which by default installed in 'autoexec.bat'. Corresponding
line looks like:



<PRE>
keyb ru,,C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\keybrd3.sys
</PRE>

<P>
(That's for russian locale.) You should comment that line if you want
your keys working properly. Of course, this will deprive you of your
local alphabet keyboard support, so you should think about
another localizer. ex-USSR users are of course knowledgeable of Keyrus
localizer, and it might work for other locales too, since it has keyboard
layout editor. But it has russian messages and documentation ;-(
Reference URL is http://www.hnet.ru/software/contrib/Utils/KeyRus/

properly).




<H3><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="faq.html#TOC50">Is it OK to have multiple copies of the DLL?</A></H3>

<P>
You should only have one copy of the Cygwin DLL on your system.  If you
have multiple versions, they will conflict and cause problems.


<P>
If you get the error "shared region is corrupted" or "shared region
version mismatch" it means you have multiple versions of cygwin1.dll
running at the same time.  This could happen, for example, if you update
cygwin1.dll without exiting <EM>all</EM> Cygwin apps (including inetd)
beforehand.


<P>
If you're trying to find multiple versions of the DLL that are causing
this problem, reboot first, in case DLLs still loaded in memory are the
cause.  Then use the Windows System find utility to search your whole
machine, not just components in your PATH (as 'type' would do) or
cygwin-mounted filesystems (as Cygwin 'find' would do).




<H3><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="faq.html#TOC51">Where can I find "more"?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="faq.html#TOC52">Why isn't package XXXX available in Cygwin?  (Or, why is your package so out of date?)</A></H3>

<P>
Probably because there is nobody willing or able to maintain it.  It
takes time, and the priority for the Cygwin Team is the Cygwin package.
The rest is a volunteer effort.  Want to contribute?  See below.




<H3><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="faq.html#TOC53">How can I access other drives?</A></H3>

<P>
You have some flexibility here.


<P>
Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.


<P>
In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&#60;drive&#62;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:

<PRE>
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</PRE>

<P>
and

<PRE>
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /
</PRE>

<P>
for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.


<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.


<P>
You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:

<PRE>
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</PRE>

<P>
Then <SAMP>`/cygdrive/c/Windows'</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>`/c/Windows'</SAMP> which is a
little less typing.


<P>
Note that you only need to mount drives once.  The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely.
You can only get rid of them with umount, or the registry editor.


<P>
The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode
("binmode") where text and binary files are treated equivalently.  This
should only be necessary for badly ported Unix programs where binary
flags are missing from open calls.  It is also the setting for /,
/usr/bin and /usr/lib in a default Cygwin installation.  The default for
new mounts is text mode ("textmode"), which is also the mode for all
"cygdrive" mounts.


<P>
You can change the default <SAMP>`cygdrive'</SAMP> prefix and whether it is
binmode or textmode using the <CODE>mount</CODE> command.  For example,

<PRE>
	bash$ mount -b --change-cygdrive-prefix cygdrive
</PRE>

<P>
will change all <CODE>/cygdrive/...</CODE> mounts to binmode.




<H3><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="faq.html#TOC54">How can I copy and paste into Cygwin console windows?</A></H3>

<P>
First, consider using rxvt instead of the standard console window.  In

<P>
Under Windows NT, open the properties dialog of the console window.

<P>
Under Windows 9x, open the properties dialog of the console window.

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
This usually means that you are trying to mount to a location

<P>
If you are trying to umount '/' and are getting this message, you may

<H3><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="faq.html#TOC56">How can I share files between Unix and Windows?</A></H3>

<P>
During development, we have both Unix boxes running Samba and
NT/Windows 95/98 machines.  We often build with cross-compilers
under Unix and copy binaries and source to the Windows system
or just toy with them directly off the Samba-mounted partition.
On dual-boot NT/Windows 9x machines, we usually use the FAT
filesystem so we can also access the files under Windows 9x.




<H3><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="faq.html#TOC57">Are mixed-case filenames possible with Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case.  A prime example
of this is perl's configuration script, which wants <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and
<CODE>makefile</CODE>.  WIN32 can't tell the difference between files with
just different case, so the configuration fails.


<P>
In releases prior to beta 16, mount had a special mixed case option
which renamed files in such a way as to allow mixed case filenames.  We
chose to remove the support when we rewrote the path handling code for
beta 16.  The standard Windows apps -- explorer.exe,
cmd.exe/command.com, etc. -- do not distinguish filenames that differed
only in case, resulting in some (very) undesirable behavior.


<P>
Sergey Okhapkin had maintained a mixed-case patch ('coolview') until
about B20.1, but this has not been updated to recent versions of Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC58" HREF="faq.html#TOC58">What about DOS special filenames?</A></H3>

<P>
Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either as
the root filename or as the extension part.  If you do, you'll have
trouble.  Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.




<H3><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="faq.html#TOC59">When it hangs, how do I get it back?</A></H3>

<P>
If something goes wrong and the tools hang on you for some reason (easy
to do if you try and read a file called aux.sh), first try hitting ^C to
return to bash or the cmd prompt.


<P>
If you start up another shell, and applications don't run, it's a good
bet that the hung process is still running somewhere.  Use the Task
Manager, pview, or a similar utility to kill the process.


<P>
And, if all else fails, there's always the reset button/power switch.
This should never be necessary under Windows NT.




<H3><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="faq.html#TOC60">Why the weird directory structure?</A></H3>

<P>
Why do /lib and /usr/lib (and /bin, /usr/bin) point to the same thing?


<P>
Why use mounts instead of symbolic links?


<P>
Can I use a disk root (e.g., C:\) as Cygwin root?  Why is this discouraged?


<P>
After a new installation in the default location, your mount points will
look something like this:



<PRE>
	bash$ mount
	C:\cygwin\bin on /usr/bin type system (binmode)
	C:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type system (binmode)
	C:\cygwin on / type system (binmode)
</PRE>

<P>
(Exactly what you see depends on what options you gave to <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.)


<P>
Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <EM>really</EM> know what you are doing.


<P>
Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.


<P>
Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.


<P>
Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <EM>So don't do this!</EM>


<P>
It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.
(Maybe you have nothing like that installed now, but who knows about
things you might add in the future?)




<H3><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="faq.html#TOC61">How do anti-virus programs like Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Users have reported that NAI (formerly McAfee) VirusScan for NT (and
others?) is incompatible with Cygwin.  This is because it tries to scan
the newly loaded shared memory in cygwin1.dll, which can cause fork() to
fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools.  (It is not confirmed that
this is still a problem, however.)


<P>
There have been several reports of NAI VirusScan causing the system to
hang when unpacking tar.gz archives.  This is surely a bug in VirusScan,
and should be reported to NAI.  The only workaround is to disable
VirusScan when accessing these files.  This can be an issue during
setup, and is discussed in that FAQ entry.


<P>
Some users report a significant performance hit using Cygwin when their
anti-virus software is enabled.  Rather than disable the anti-virus
software completely, it may be possible to specify directories whose
contents are exempt from scanning.  In a default installation, this
would be <SAMP>`<CODE>C:\cygwin\bin</CODE>'</SAMP>.  Obviously, this could be
exploited by a hostile non-Cygwin program, so do this at your own risk.




<H3><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="faq.html#TOC62">Is there a Cygwin port of GNU Emacs?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes!  It uses the X11 (<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/xfree/">http://cygwin.com/xfree/</A></STRONG>) Windows
interface.  From a remote login shell, this "emacs -nw" works fine.
There is also a non-X11 version which just provides the text-only
terminal interface.  Use Cygwin Setup to install either one (or both).




<H3><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="faq.html#TOC63">What about NT Emacs?</A></H3>

<P>
If you want GNU Emacs with a native Microsoft Windows interface, but
without X, then you must use the native Windows port, commonly known
as "NT Emacs".  You get NT Emacs from any GNU mirror.  It is not
available from Cygwin Setup.


<P>
NT Emacs uses the Windows command shell by default.  Since it is not a
Cygwin application, it has no knowledge of Cygwin mounts.  With those
points in mind, you need to add the following code to your ~/.emacs
(or ~/_emacs) file in order to use Cygwin bash.  This is particularly useful
for the JDEE package (<STRONG><A HREF="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">http://jdee.sunsite.dk/</A></STRONG>).  The following
settings are for Emacs 21.1:



<PRE>
	;; This assumes that Cygwin is installed in C:\cygwin (the

	(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\cygwin\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))
	;;

For a concise description of the current situation with XEmacs, see
this message from the Cygwin mailing list:
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2002-11/msg00609.html">http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2002-11/msg00609.html</A></STRONG>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="faq.html#TOC65">Is there a better alternative to the standard console window?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes!  Use rxvt instead.  It's an optional package in Cygwin Setup.
You can use it with or without X11.  You can resize it easily by
dragging an edge or corner.  Copy and paste is easy with the left and
middle mouse buttons, respectively.  It will honor settings in your
~/.Xdefaults file, even without X.


<P>
Don't invoke as simply "rxvt" because that will run /bin/sh (really
ash) which is not a good interactive shell.  For details see
<CODE>/usr/doc/Cygwin/rxvt-&#60;ver&#62;.README</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="faq.html#TOC66">info error "dir: No such file or directory"</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin packages install their info documentation in the
<CODE>/usr/share/info</CODE> directory.  But you need to create a <CODE>dir</CODE>
file there before the standalone info program (probably
<CODE>/usr/bin/info</CODE>) can be used to read those info files.  This is how
you do it:

<PRE>
	bash$ cd /usr/share/info
	bash$ for f in *.info ; do install-info $f dir ; done
</PRE>

<P>
This may generate warnings:

<PRE>
	install-info: warning: no info dir entry in `gzip.info'
	install-info: warning: no info dir entry in `time.info'
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>install-info</CODE> command cannot parse these files, so you will
have to add their entries to <CODE>/usr/share/info/dir</CODE> by hand.


<P>
Even if the dir file already exists, you may have to update it when
you install new Cygwin packages.  Some packages update the dir file
for you, but many don't.




<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="faq.html#TOC67">Why do I get a message saying Out of Queue slots?</A></H3>

<P>
"Out of queue slots!" generally occurs when you're trying to remove
many files that you do not have permission to remove (either because
you don't have permission, they are opened exclusively, etc).  What
happens is Cygwin queues up these files with the supposition that it
will be possible to delete these files in the future.  Assuming that
the permission of an affected file does change later on, the file will
be deleted as requested.  However, if too many requests come in to
delete inaccessible files, the queue overflows and you get the message
you're asking about.  Usually you can remedy this with a quick chmod,
close of a file, or other such thing.  (Thanks to Larry Hall for
this explanation).




<H3><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="faq.html#TOC68">Why don't symlinks work on samba-mounted filesystems?</A></H3>

<P>
Symlinks are marked with "system" file attribute.  Samba does not
enable this attribute by default.  To enable it, consult your Samba
documentation and then add these lines to your samba configuration
file:



<PRE>
	map system = yes
	create mask = 0775
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the 0775 can be anything as long as the 0010 bit is set.




<H3><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="faq.html#TOC69">Why does df report sizes incorrectly.</A></H3>

<P>
There is a bug in the Win32 API function GetFreeDiskSpace that

Perhaps that may be your problem?




<H3><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="faq.html#TOC70">Why doesn't Cygwin tcl/tk understand Cygwin paths?</A></H3>

<P>
The versions of Tcl/Tk distributed with Cygwin (e.g. cygtclsh80.exe,
cygwish80.exe) are not actually "Cygwin versions" of those tools.
They are built with the <SAMP>`-mno-cygwin'</SAMP> option to <CODE>gcc</CODE>, which
means they do not understand Cygwin mounts or symbolic links.


<P>
See the entry "How do I convert between Windows and UNIX paths?"
elsewhere in this FAQ.


<H2><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="faq.html#TOC71">Cygwin API Questions</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="faq.html#TOC72">How does everything work?</A></H3>

<P>
There's a C library which provides a Unix-style API.  The
applications are linked with it and voila - they run on Windows.


<P>
The aim is to add all the goop necessary to make your apps run on
Windows into the C library.  Then your apps should run on Unix and
Windows with no changes at the source level.


<P>
The C library is in a DLL, which makes basic applications quite small.
And it allows relatively easy upgrades to the Win32/Unix translation
layer, providing that DLL changes stay backward-compatible.


<P>
For a good overview of Cygwin, you may want to read the paper on Cygwin
published by the Usenix Association in conjunction with the 2d Usenix NT
Symposium in August 1998.  It is available in HTML format on the project
WWW site.




<H3><A NAME="SEC73" HREF="faq.html#TOC73">Are development snapshots for the Cygwin library available?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes.  They're made whenever anything interesting happens inside the
Cygwin library (usually roughly on a nightly basis, depending on how much
is going on).  They are only intended for those people who wish to
contribute code to the project.  If you aren't going to be happy
debugging problems in a buggy snapshot, avoid these and wait for a real
release.  The snapshots are available from
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/snapshots/">http://cygwin.com/snapshots/</A></STRONG>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="faq.html#TOC74">How is the DOS/Unix CR/LF thing handled?</A></H3>

<P>
Let's start with some background.


<P>
In UNIX, a file is a file and what the file contains is whatever the
program/programmer/user told it to put into it.  In Windows, a file is
also a file and what the file contains depends not only on the
program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode.


<P>
When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially.  A \n (new line) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return) so that if you `printf("Hello\n") you in fact get
"Hello\r\n".  Upon reading this combination, the \r is removed and the
number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less than was actually read.
This tends to confuse programs dependent on ftell() and fseek().  A
Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even
though it truly isn't the end of file.


<P>
One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to easily mix Cygwin-ported
Unix programs with generic Windows programs.  As a result, Cygwin opens
files in text mode as is normal under Windows.  In the accompanying
tools, tools that deal with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in Unix
binary mode and tools that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in
text mode.


<P>
Some people push the notion of globally setting the default processing
mode to binary via mount point options or by setting the CYGWIN
environment variable.  But that creates a different problem.  In
binary mode, the program receives all of the data in the file, including
a \r.  Since the programs will no longer deal with these properly for
you, you would have to remove the \r from the relevant text files,
especially scripts and startup resource files.  This is a porter "cop
out", forcing the user to deal with the \r for the porter.


<P>
It is rather easy for the porter to fix the source code by supplying the
appropriate file processing mode switches to the open/fopen functions.
Treat all text files as text and treat all binary files as binary.
To be specific, you can select binary mode by adding <CODE>O_BINARY</CODE> to
the second argument of an <CODE>open</CODE> call, or <CODE>"b"</CODE> to second
argument of an <CODE>fopen</CODE> call.  You can also call <CODE>setmode (fd,
O_BINARY)</CODE>.


<P>
Note that because the open/fopen switches are defined by ANSI, they
exist under most flavors of Unix; open/fopen will just ignore the switch
since they have no meaning to UNIX.

<H3><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="faq.html#TOC75">Is the Cygwin library multi-thread-safe?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes.


<P>
There is also extensive support for 'POSIX threads', see the file
<CODE>cygwin.din</CODE> for the list of POSIX thread functions provided.




<H3><A NAME="SEC76" HREF="faq.html#TOC76">Why is some functionality only supported in Windows NT?</A></H3>

<P>
Windows 9x: n.
32 bit extensions and a graphical shell for a 16 bit patch to an
8 bit operating system originally coded for a 4 bit microprocessor,
written by a 2 bit company that can't stand 1 bit of competition.


<P>
But seriously, Windows 9x lacks most of the security-related calls and
has several other deficiencies with respect to its version of the Win32
API.  See the calls.texinfo document for more information as to what
is not supported in Win 9x.




<H3><A NAME="SEC77" HREF="faq.html#TOC77">How is fork() implemented?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin fork() essentially works like a non-copy on write version
of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do).  Because of this it
can be a little slow.  In most cases, you are better off using the
spawn family of calls if possible.


<P>
Here's how it works:


<P>
Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself.  Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks).  Parent fills in the child's
.data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into
the suspended child's address space.  Parent then starts the child.
Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.  Child starts and
discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump
buffer.  Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on
another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap.  Parent
notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into
child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the
fork call.  Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped
areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.




<H3><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="faq.html#TOC78">How does wildcarding (globbing) work?</A></H3>

<P>
If the DLL thinks it was invoked from a DOS style prompt, it runs a
`globber' over the arguments provided on the command line.  This means
that if you type <CODE>LS *.EXE</CODE> from DOS, it will do what you might
expect.


<P>
Beware: globbing uses <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  If your application defines
<CODE>malloc</CODE>, that will get used.  This may do horrible things to you.




<H3><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="faq.html#TOC79">How do symbolic links work?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin knows of two ways to create symlinks.


<P>
The old method is the only valid one up to but not including version 1.3.0.
If it's enabled (from 1.3.0 on by setting `nowinsymlinks' in the environment
variable CYGWIN) Cygwin generates link files with a magic header.  When you
open a file or directory that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file
or directory listed in the magic header.  Because we don't want to have to
open every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin marks symlinks
with the system attribute.  Files without the system attribute are not
checked.  Because remote samba filesystems do not enable the system
attribute by default, symlinks do not work on network drives unless you
explicitly enable this attribute.


<P>
The new method which is introduced with Cygwin version 1.3.0 is enabled
by default or if `winsymlinks' is set in the environment variable CYGWIN.
Using this method, Cygwin generates symlinks by creating Windows shortcuts.
Cygwin created shortcuts have a special header (which is in that way never
created by Explorer) and the R/O attribute set.  A DOS path is stored in
the shortcut as usual and the description entry is used to store the POSIX
path.  While the POSIX path is stored as is, the DOS path has perhaps to be
rearranged to result in a valid path.  This may result in a divergence
between the DOS and the POSIX path when symlinks are moved crossing mount
points.  When a user changes the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin
and it will only use the DOS path then.  While Cygwin shortcuts are shown
without the ".lnk" suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin shortcuts are shown
with the suffix.  However, both are treated as symlinks.


<P>
Both, the old and the new symlinks can live peacefully together since Cygwin
treats both as symlinks regardless of the setting of `(no)winsymlinks' in
the environment variable CYGWIN.




<H3><A NAME="SEC80" HREF="faq.html#TOC80">Why do some files, which are not executables have the 'x' type.</A></H3>

<P>
When working out the Unix-style attribute bits on a file, the library
has to fill out some information not provided by the WIN32 API.  


<P>
It guesses that files ending in .exe and .bat are executable, as are
ones which have a "#!" as their first characters.




<H3><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="faq.html#TOC81">How secure is Cygwin in a multi-user environment?</A></H3>

<P>
As of version 1.5.13, the Cygwin developers are not aware of any feature
in the cygwin dll that would allow users to gain privileges or to access
objects to which they have no rights under Windows. However there is no
guarantee that Cygwin is as secure as the Windows it runs on.  Cygwin
processes share some variables and are thus easier targets of denial of
service type of attacks.




<H3><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="faq.html#TOC82">How do the net-related functions work?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
The network support in Cygwin is supposed to provide the Unix API, not
the Winsock API.


<P>
There are differences between the semantics of functions with the same
name under the API.


<P>
E.g., the select system call on Unix can wait on a standard file handles
and handles to sockets.  The select call in Winsock can only wait on
sockets.  Because of this, cygwin.dll does a lot of nasty stuff behind
the scenes, trying to persuade various Winsock/win32 functions to do what
a Unix select would do.


<P>
If you are porting an application which already uses Winsock, then
using the net support in Cygwin is wrong.


<P>
But you can still use native Winsock, and use Cygwin.  The functions
which cygwin.dll exports are called 'cygwin_&#60;name&#62;'.  There
are a load of defines which map the standard Unix names to the names
exported by the DLL-- check out include/netdb.h:



<PRE>
..etc..
void		cygwin_setprotoent (int);
void		cygwin_setservent (int);
void		cygwin_setrpcent (int);
..etc..
#ifndef __INSIDE_CYGWIN_NET__
#define endprotoent cygwin_endprotoent 
#define endservent cygwin_endservent 
#define endrpcent  cygwin_endrpcent  
..etc..
</PRE>

<P>
The idea is that you'll get the Unix-&#62;Cygwin mapping if you include
the standard Unix header files.  If you use this, you won't need to
link with libwinsock.a - all the net stuff is inside the DLL.


<P>
The mywinsock.h file is a standard winsock.h which has been hacked to
remove the bits which conflict with the standard Unix API, or are
defined in other headers.  E.g., in mywinsock.h, the definition of
struct hostent is removed.  This is because on a Unix box, it lives in
netdb.  It isn't a good idea to use it in your applications.


<P>
As of the b19 release, this information may be slightly out of date.




<H3><A NAME="SEC83" HREF="faq.html#TOC83">I don't want Unix sockets, how do I use normal Win32 winsock?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
To use the vanilla Win32 winsock, you just need to #define Win32_Winsock
and #include "windows.h" at the top of your source file(s).  You'll also
want to add -lwsock32 to the compiler's command line so you link against
libwsock32.a.




<H3><A NAME="SEC84" HREF="faq.html#TOC84">What version numbers are associated with Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin versioning is relatively complicated because of its status as a
shared library.  First of all, since October 1998 every Cygwin DLL has
been named <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> and has a 1 in the release name.
Additionally, there are DLL major and minor numbers that correspond to
the name of the release, and a release number. In other words,
cygwin-1.5.10-2 is <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE>, major version 5, minor version
10, release 2.


<P>
The <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> major version number gets incremented only when a
change is made that makes existing software incompatible. For example,
the first major version 5 release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added 64-bit file I/O
operations, which required many libraries to be recompiled and relinked.
The minor version changes every time we make a new backward compatible
Cygwin release available.  There is also a <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> release
version number.  The release number is only incremented if we update an
existing release in a way that does not effect the DLL (like a missing
header file).


<P>
There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.  The major number
tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to the API.
An executable linked with an earlier major number will not be compatible
with the latest DLL.  The minor number tracks significant API additions
or changes that will not break older executables but may be required by
newly compiled ones.


<P>
Then there is a shared memory region compatibility version number.  It is
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared memory
region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.  Finally there
is a mount point registry version number which keeps track
of non-backwards-compatible changes to the registry mount table layout.
This has been <CODE>mounts v2</CODE> for a long time. For more exciting Cygwin
version number details, check out the <CODE>/usr/include/cygwin/version.h</CODE>
file.

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
Did you explicitly call tzset() before checking the value of _timezone?
If not, you must do so.




<H3><A NAME="SEC86" HREF="faq.html#TOC86">Is there a mouse interface?</A></H3>

<P>
There is no way to capture mouse events from Cygwin.  There are

<P>
If you are willing to be a package maintainer, great.  We urgently need
volunteers to prepare and maintain packages, because the priority of the
Cygwin Team is Cygwin itself.


<P>
The Cygwin Package Contributor's Guide is at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</A></STRONG>, which details everything you need

questions about package maintenance, <EM>after</EM> searching and browsing the
cygwin-apps list archives, of course.  Charles Wilson posted a short
recipe of what is involved, using texinfo as an example, available at

should give you an idea of what is required.


<P>
You should announce your intentions to the general cygwin list, in case
others were thinking the same thing.

<H3><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="faq.html#TOC90">Why are compiled executables so huge?!?</A></H3>

<P>
By default, gcc compiles in all symbols.  You'll also find that gcc
creates large executables on UNIX.


<P>
If that bothers you, just use the 'strip' program, part of the binutils
package.  Or compile with the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option to gcc.




<H3><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="faq.html#TOC91">Where is glibc?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin does not provide glibc.  It uses newlib instead, which provides
much (but not all) of the same functionality.  Porting glibc to Cygwin
would be difficult.




<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="faq.html#TOC92">Where is Objective C?</A></H3>

<P>
Objective C is not distributed with the Cygwin version of gcc, and there
are no plans to do so.  The gcc package maintainer had difficulty
building it, and once built there were problems using it.  It appears
that there is only minimal support for the Objective C front-end in the
main GCC distribution, anyway.




<H3><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="faq.html#TOC93">Why is make behaving badly?</A></H3>

<P>
First of all, if you are using <SAMP>`make -j[N]'</SAMP>, then stop.  It doesn't
work well.


<P>
Otherwise, read on...


<P>
Make has two operating modes, UNIX and WIN32.  You need to make sure
that you are operating in the right mode.


<P>
In UNIX mode, make uses sh.exe as a subshell.  The path list separator
is ':', '\' is the escape character, POSIX paths are expected, and
Cygwin mounts will be understood.  Use this for Makefiles written for
UNIX.


<P>
In WIN32 mode, make uses the "native" command shell (cmd.exe or
command.com), with all the restrictions that implies.  The path list
separator is ';', the path separator is '\', "copy" and "del" work, but
the Cygwin mount table is not understood.  Use this for nmake-style
Makefiles.


<P>
The default mode for the Net Release of make (the one installed by
<CODE>setup.exe</CODE>) is UNIX.  The default mode for commercial releases to
Redhat (formerly Cygnus) customers is WIN32.


<P>
You can override the default by setting the environment variable
MAKE_MODE to "UNIX" (actually case is not significant) or "WIN32"
(actually anything other than "UNIX").  You can also specify the options
--unix or --win32 on the make command line.

<H3><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="faq.html#TOC95">How do I use Win32 API calls?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
It's pretty simple actually.  Cygwin tools require that you explicitly
link the import libraries for whatever Win32 API functions that you
are going to use, with the exception of kernel32, which is linked
automatically (because the startup and/or built-in code uses it).


<P>
For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you must link
with gdi32 like this:


<P>
gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32


<P>
or (compiling and linking in one step):


<P>
gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32


<P>
The following libraries are available for use in this way:


<P>
advapi32  largeint  ole32     scrnsave  vfw32
cap       lz32      oleaut32  shell32   win32spl
comctl32  mapi32    oledlg    snmp      winmm
comdlg32  mfcuia32  olepro32  svrapi    winserve
ctl3d32   mgmtapi   opengl32  tapi32    winspool
dlcapi    mpr       penwin32  th32      winstrm
gdi32     msacm32   pkpd32    thunk32   wow32
glaux     nddeapi   rasapi32  url       wsock32
glu32     netapi32  rpcdce4   user32    wst
icmp      odbc32    rpcndr    uuid
imm32     odbccp32  rpcns4    vdmdbg
kernel32  oldnames  rpcrt4    version


<P>
The regular setup allows you to use the option -mwindows on the
command line to include a set of the basic libraries (and also
make your program a GUI program instead of a console program),
including user32, gdi32 and, IIRC, comdlg32.


<P>
Note that you should never include -lkernel32 on your link line
unless you are invoking ld directly.  Do not include the same import
library twice on your link line.  Finally, it is a good idea to
put import libraries last on your link line, or at least after
all the object files and static libraries that reference them.


<P>
The first two are related to problems the linker has (as of b18 at least)
when import libraries are referenced twice.  Tables get messed up and
programs crash randomly.  The last point has to do with the fact that
gcc processes the files listed on the command line in sequence and
will only resolve references to libraries if they are given after
the file that makes the reference.




<H3><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="faq.html#TOC96">How do I compile a Win32 executable that doesn't use Cygwin?</A></H3>

The -mno-cygwin flag to gcc makes gcc link against standard Microsoft
DLLs instead of Cygwin.  This is desirable for native Windows programs
that don't need a UNIX emulation layer.


<P>
This is not to be confused with 'MinGW' (Minimalist GNU for Windows),
which is a completely separate effort.  That project's home page is
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml">http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml</A></STRONG>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="faq.html#TOC97">Can I build a Cygwin program that does not require cygwin1.dll at runtime?</A></H3>

<P>
No.  If your program uses the Cygwin API, then your executable cannot
run without cygwin1.dll.  In particular, it is not possible to
statically link with a Cygwin library to obtain an independent,
self-contained executable.


<P>
If this is an issue because you intend to distribute your Cygwin
application, then you had better read and understand
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">http://cygwin.com/licensing.html</A></STRONG>, which explains the licensing
options.  Unless you purchase a special commercial license from Red
Hat, then your Cygwin application must be Open Source.




<H3><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="faq.html#TOC98">Can I link with both MSVCRT*.DLL and cygwin1.dll?</A></H3>

<P>
No, you must use one or the other, they are mutually exclusive.




<H3><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="faq.html#TOC99">How do I make the console window go away?</A></H3>

<P>
The default during compilation is to produce a console application.
It you are writing a GUI program, you should either compile with
-mwindows as explained above, or add the string
"-Wl,--subsystem,windows" to the GCC command line.




<H3><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="faq.html#TOC100">Why does make complain about a "missing separator"?</A></H3>

<P>
This problem usually occurs as a result of someone editing a Makefile
with a text editor that replaces tab characters with spaces.  Command
lines must start with tabs.  This is not specific to Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="faq.html#TOC101">Why can't we redistribute Microsoft's Win32 headers?</A></H3>

<P>
Subsection 2.d.f of the `Microsoft Open Tools License agreement' looks
like it says that one may not "permit further redistribution of the
Redistributables to their end users".  We take this to mean that we can
give them to you, but you can't give them to anyone else, which is
something that Red Hat can't agree to.  Fortunately, we
have our own Win32 headers which are pretty complete.




<H3><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="faq.html#TOC102">How do I link against <SAMP>`cygwin1.dll'</SAMP> with Visual Studio?</A></H3>

<P>
To my knowledge, none of the Cygwin developers have done this, but we
have this report from the mailing list that it can be done this way:



<OL>
<LI>Use the impdef program to generate a .def file for the cygwin1.dll

(if you build the cygwin dll from source, you will already have a def
file)


<PRE>
impdef cygwin1.dll &#62; cygwin1.def
</PRE>

<LI>Use the MS VS linker (lib) to generate an import library


<PRE>
lib /def=cygwin1.def /out=cygwin1.lib
</PRE>

<LI>Create a file "my_crt0.c" with the following contents


<PRE>
#include &#60;sys/cygwin.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;

typedef int (*MainFunc) (int argc, char *argv[], char **env);

void
  my_crt0 (MainFunc f)
  {
    cygwin_crt0(f);
  }
</PRE>

<LI>Use gcc in a Cygwin prompt to build my_crt0.c into a DLL

       (e.g. my_crt0.dll). Follow steps 1 and 2 to generate .def and
       .lib files for the DLL.

<LI>Download crt0.c from the cygwin website and include it in

       your sources. Modify it to call my_crt0() instead of
       cygwin_crt0().  Since you are using Cygwin source code, your
       resulting program will be licensed under the GNU GPL. For more
       information, see <STRONG><A HREF="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html</A></STRONG>.  

<LI>Build your object files using the MS VC compiler cl.

<LI>Link your object files, cygwin1.lib, and my_crt0.lib (or

       whatever you called it) into the executable.
</OL>

<P>
Note that if you are using any other Cygwin based libraries
that you will probably need to build them as DLLs using gcc and
then generate import libraries for the MS VC linker.


<P>

<H3><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="faq.html#TOC103">How do I link against a <SAMP>`.lib'</SAMP> file?</A></H3>

If your <SAMP>`.lib'</SAMP> file is a normal static or import library with
C-callable entry points, you can list <SAMP>`foo.lib'</SAMP> as an object file for
gcc/g++, just like any <SAMP>`*.o'</SAMP> file. Otherwise, here are some steps:



<OL>
<LI>Build a C file with a function table.  Put all functions you intend

to use in that table.  This forces the linker to include all the object
files from the .lib.  Maybe there is an option to force LINK.EXE to
include an object file.

<LI>Build a .def with all the exports you need.

<LI>Link with your .lib using link.exe.

</OL>

<P>
or



<OL>
<LI>Extract all the object files from the .lib using LIB.EXE.

<LI>Build a dummy C file referencing all the functions you need, either

      with a direct call or through an initialized function pointer.
<LI>Build a dummy LibMain.

<LI>Link all the objects with this file+LibMain.

<LI>Write a .def.

<LI>Link.

</OL>

<P>
You can use these methods to use MSVC (and many other runtime libs)
with Cygwin development tools.


<P>
Note that this is a lot of work (half a day or so), but much less than
rewriting the runtime library in question from specs...


<P>
Thanks to Jacob Navia (root at jacob dot remcomp dot fr) for this explanation.




<H3><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="faq.html#TOC104">How do I build Cygwin on my own?</A></H3>

<P>
First, you need to get the Cygwin source.  Ideally, you should check out
what you need from CVS (<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cvs.html">http://cygwin.com/cvs.html</A></STRONG>).  This is the
<EM>preferred method</EM> for acquiring the sources.  Otherwise, you can
install the cygwin source package from the distribution.


<P>
If you are trying to duplicate a cygwin release then you should just
download the corresponding source package and use "tar xjf" to unpack
it.  This will unpack the sources into a directory named cygwin-x.y.z-n,
where x.y.z-n correspond to the version numbering of the tar.bz2
package.



<PRE>
tar xjf cygwin-1.5.12-1-src.tar.bz2
cd cygwin-1.5.12-1
</PRE>

<P>
You <EM>must</EM> build cygwin in a separate directory from the source,
so create something like a <SAMP>`build/'</SAMP> directory.  You will also want
to install to a temporary location:



<PRE>
mkdir build
mkdir /install 
cd build
(../configure --prefix=/install -v; make) &#62;&#38; make.out
make install &#62; install.log 2&#62;&#38;1
</PRE>

<P>
Normally, this procedure ignore errors in building the documentation.
which requires the <SAMP>`docbook-xml'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`docbook-xsl'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`xmlto'</SAMP> packages.  For more information on building the
documentation, see the README included in the cygwin-doc package.


<P>
To check a cygwin1.dll, run "make check" in the winsup/testsuite
directory.  If that works, install everything <EM>except</EM> the dll (if
you can).  Then, close down all cygwin programs (including bash windows,
inetd, etc.), save your old dll, and copy the new dll to the correct
place.  Then start up a bash window, or  run a cygwin program from the
Windows command prompt, and see what happens.


<P>
If you get the error "shared region is corrupted" it means that two
different versions of cygwin1.dll are running on your machine at the
same time. Remove all but one. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="faq.html#TOC105">I may have found a bug in Cygwin, how can I debug it (the symbols in gdb look funny)?</A></H3>

<P>
Debugging symbols are stripped from distibuted Cygwin binaries, so any
symbols that you see in gdb are basically meaningless. It is also a good
idea to use the latest code in case the bug has been fixed, so we
recommend trying the latest snapshot from
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/snapshots/">http://cygwin.com/snapshots/</A></STRONG> or build the DLL from CVS.


<P>
To build a debugging version of the Cygwin DLL, you will need to follow
the instructions at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC102">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC102</A></STRONG>. You
can also contact the mailing list for pointers (a simple test case that
demonstrates the bug is always welcome).




<H3><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="faq.html#TOC106">How can I compile Cygwin for an unsupported platform (PowerPC, Alpha, ARM, Itanium)?</A></H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, this will be difficult.  Exception handling and signals
support semantics and args have been designed for x86 so you would need
to write specific support for your platform.  We don't know of any other
incompatibilities. Please send us patches if you do this work!




<H3><A NAME="SEC107" HREF="faq.html#TOC107">How can I adjust the heap/stack size of an application?</A></H3>

<P>
If you need to change the maximum amount of memory available to Cygwin, see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html</A></STRONG>. Otherwise,
just pass heap/stack linker arguments to gcc.  To create foo.exe with
a heap size of 1024 and a stack size of 4096, you would invoke
gcc as:


<P>
<CODE>gcc -Wl,--heap,1024,--stack,4096 -o foo foo.c</CODE>




<H3><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="faq.html#TOC108">How can I find out which DLLs are needed by an executable?</A></H3>

<P>
<SAMP>`objdump -p'</SAMP> provides this information, but is rather verbose.


<P>
<SAMP>`cygcheck'</SAMP> will do this much more concisely, and operates
recursively, provided the command is in your path.


<P>
Note there is currently a bug in cygcheck in that it will not report
on a program in a Windows system dir (e.g., C:\Windows or C:\WINNT) even
if it's in your path.  To work around this, supply the full Win32 path
to the executable, including the .exe extension:



<PRE>
cygcheck c:\\winnt\\system32\\cmd.exe
</PRE>

<P>
(Note the windows path separator must be escaped if this is typed in
bash.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="faq.html#TOC109">How do I build a DLL?</A></H3>

related messages.)</STRONG>


<P>
You must execute the following sequence of five commands, in this
order:



<PRE>
$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
        --base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE EXPFILE -dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
	--base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) EXPFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld.


<P>
$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool.


<P>
$(AS) is the assembler, as.


<P>
DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create, e.g., tcl80.dll.


<P>
OBJS is the list of object files you want to put into the DLL.


<P>
LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the DLL against.  For
example, you may or may not want -lcygwin.  You may want -lkernel32.
Tcl links against -lcygwin -ladvapi32 -luser32 -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32
-lkernel32.


<P>
DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file.  A simple DEFFILE would
consist of "EXPORTS" followed by a list of all symbols which should
be exported from the DLL.  Each symbol should be on a line by itself.
Other programs will only be able to access the listed symbols.


<P>
BASEFILE is a temporary file that is used during this five stage
process, e.g., tcl.base.


<P>
EXPFILE is another temporary file, e.g., tcl.exp.


<P>
ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to use as the entry
point.  This function should be defined using the WINAPI attribute,
and should take three arguments:
        int WINAPI startup (HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID)


<P>
This means that the actual symbol name will have an appended <A HREF="mailto:@12">@12</A>, so if
your entry point really is named <SAMP>`startup'</SAMP>, the string you should
use for ENTRY in the above examples would be <SAMP>`<A HREF="mailto:startup@12">startup@12</A>'</SAMP>.


<P>
If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the entry function will need
to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer.  You can do that by declaring
a global variable <SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP>, and then initializing it in the
entry function.  Be careful not to export the global variable
<SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP> from your DLL; that is, do not put it in DEFFILE.



<PRE>
/* This is a global variable.  */
struct _reent *_impure_ptr;
extern struct _reent *__imp_reent_data;

int entry (HINSTANT hinst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)
{
  _impure_ptr = __imp_reent_data;
  /* Whatever else you want to do.  */
}
</PRE>

<P>
You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines.  The
Tcl build does this, but I admit that I no longer remember whether
this is important.  Note that if you specify a --subsytem &#60;x&#62; flag to ld,
the -e entry must come after the subsystem flag, since the subsystem flag
sets a different default entry point.


<P>
You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on the $(LD) lines.
This will set the default image base.  Programs using this DLL will
start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a different portion of the
address space.  Each DLL starts at the image base, and continues for
whatever size it occupies.


<P>
Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to build a library so
that other programs can link against it.  This is not required: you
could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary.  However, if you want to be
able to link directly against the DLL, you need to create a library.
Do that like this:


<P>
$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE --output-lib LIBFILE


<P>
$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same as above.  Make
sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or things won't work right.


<P>
LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to create, e.g.,
libtcl80.a.  You can then link against that library using something
like -ltcl80 in your linker command.




<H3><A NAME="SEC112" HREF="faq.html#TOC112">How can I debug what's going on?</A></H3>

<P>
You can debug your application using <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  Make sure you
compile it with the -g flag!  If your application calls functions in
MS DLLs, gdb will complain about not being able to load debug information
for them when you run your program.  This is normal since these DLLs
don't contain debugging information (and even if they did, that debug
info would not be compatible with gdb).




<H3><A NAME="SEC113" HREF="faq.html#TOC113">Can I use a system trace mechanism instead?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes.  You can use the <CODE>strace.exe</CODE> utility to run other cygwin
programs with various debug and trace messages enabled.  For information
on using <CODE>strace</CODE>, see the Cygwin User's Guide or the file
<CODE>winsup/utils/utils.sgml</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC114" HREF="faq.html#TOC114">Why doesn't gdb handle signals?</A></H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, there is only minimal signal handling support in gdb
currently.  Signal handling only works with Windows-type signals.
SIGINT may work, SIGFPE may work, SIGSEGV definitely does.  You cannot
'stop', 'print' or 'nopass' signals like SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP to the
process being debugged.




<H3><A NAME="SEC115" HREF="faq.html#TOC115">The linker complains that it can't find something.</A></H3>

<P>
A common error is to put the library on the command line before
the thing that needs things from it.


<P>
This is wrong <CODE>gcc -lstdc++ hello.cc</CODE>.
This is right <CODE>gcc hello.cc -lstdc++</CODE>.

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
Include stdlib.h instead of malloc.h.




<H3><A NAME="SEC119" HREF="faq.html#TOC119">Can I use my own malloc?</A></H3>

<P>
If you define a function called <CODE>malloc</CODE> in your own code, and link
with the DLL, the DLL <EM>will</EM> call your <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  Needless to
say, you will run into serious problems if your malloc is buggy.


<P>
If you run any programs from the DOS command prompt, rather than from in
bash, the DLL will try and expand the wildcards on the command line.
This process uses <CODE>malloc</CODE> <EM>before</EM> your main line is started.
If you have written your own <CODE>malloc</CODE> to need some initialization
to occur after <CODE>main</CODE> is called, then this will surely break.


<P>
Moreover, there is an outstanding issue with <CODE>_malloc_r</CODE> in
<CODE>newlib</CODE>.  This re-entrant version of <CODE>malloc</CODE> will be called
directly from within <CODE>newlib</CODE>, by-passing your custom version, and
is probably incompatible with it.  But it may not be possible to replace
<CODE>_malloc_r</CODE> too, because <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> does not export it and
Cygwin does not expect your program to replace it.  This is really a
newlib issue, but we are open to suggestions on how to deal with it.




<H3><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="faq.html#TOC120">Can I mix objects compiled with msvc++ and gcc?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes, but only if you are combining C object files.  MSVC C++ uses a

<H3><A NAME="SEC121" HREF="faq.html#TOC121">Can I use the gdb debugger to debug programs built by VC++?</A></H3>

<P>
No, not for full (high level source language) debugging.
The Microsoft compilers generate a different type of debugging
symbol information, which gdb does not understand.


<P>
However, the low-level (assembly-type) symbols generated by
Microsoft compilers are coff, which gdb DOES understand.
Therefore you should at least be able to see all of your

<P>
If your scripts are in the current directory, you must have <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>

<H3><A NAME="SEC124" HREF="faq.html#TOC124">What preprocessor do I need to know about?</A></H3>

<P>
We use _WIN32 to signify access to the Win32 API and __CYGWIN__ for
access to the Cygwin environment provided by the dll.


<P>
We chose _WIN32 because this is what Microsoft defines in VC++ and
we thought it would be a good idea for compatibility with VC++ code
to follow their example.  We use _MFC_VER to indicate code that should
be compiled with VC++.


<P>
_WIN32 is only defined when you use either the -mno-cygwin or -mwin32
gcc command line options.  This is because Cygwin is supposed to be a
Unix emulation environment and defining _WIN32 confuses some programs
which think that they have to make special concessions for a Windows
environment which Cygwin handles automatically.


<P>
Note that using -mno-cygwin replaces __CYGWIN__ with __MINGW32__ as to
tell which compiler (or settings) you're running.
Check this out in detail by running, for example



<PRE>
       $ gcc  -dM -E -xc /dev/null &#62;gcc.txt

<H3><A NAME="SEC125" HREF="faq.html#TOC125">How should I port my Unix GUI to Windows?</A></H3>

<P>
There are two basic strategies for porting Unix GUIs to Windows.


<P>
The first is to use a portable graphics library such as tcl/tk, X11, or
V (and others?).  Typically, you will end up with a GUI on Windows that
requires some runtime support.  With tcl/tk, you'll want to include the
necessary library files and the tcl/tk DLLs.  In the case of X11, you'll
need everyone using your program to have an X11 server installed.


<P>
The second method is to rewrite your GUI using Win32 API calls (or MFC
with VC++).  If your program is written in a fairly modular fashion, you
may still want to use Cygwin if your program contains a lot of shared
(non-GUI-related) code.  That way you still gain some of the portability
advantages inherent in using Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC126" HREF="faq.html#TOC126">Why not use DJGPP ?</A></H3>

<P>
DJGPP is a similar idea, but for DOS instead of Win32.  DJGPP uses a
"DOS extender" to provide a more reasonable operating interface for its
applications.   The Cygwin toolset doesn't have to do this since all of
the applications are native WIN32.   Applications compiled with the
Cygwin tools can access the Win32 API functions, so you can write
programs which use the Windows GUI.

<P>
Chris Faylor is behind many of the recent changes in Cygwin.  Prior to
joining Cygnus, he contributed significant fixes to the process control
and environ code, reworked the strace mechanism, and rewrote the
signal-related code from scratch as a Net contributor.  In addition to
continuing to make technical contributions, Chris is also currently the
group's manager.


<P>
Corinna Vinschen has contributed several useful fixes to the path
handling code, console support, improved security handling, and raw
device support.  Corinna is currently employed by Red Hat as a
GDB/Cygwin engineer.


<P>
DJ Delorie has done important work in profiling Cygwin,
worked on the Dejagnu automated testing framework, merged the dlltool
functionality into ld, wrote a good deal of the Cygwin Users' Guide,
authored the cygcheck utility, and made automated snapshots available
from our project WWW page.  DJ is currently employed by Red Hat as
a GCC engineer.


<P>
Egor Duda has contributed many useful fixes.  He is responsible for
Cygwin's ability to start a debugger on detection of a fatal error
as well as produce core dumps.


<P>
Robert Collins has contributed many improvements to thread handling
as well as generic fixes to cygwin itself.


<P>
Kazuhiro Fujieda has contributed many bug fixes and bug reports.


<P>
Earnie Boyd has contributed many bug fixes and is the mingw and w32api
maintainer.


<P>
David Starks-Browning is our dedicated FAQ maintainer.


<P>
Geoffrey Noer took over the Cygwin project from its initial author Steve
Chamberlain in mid-1996.  As maintainer, he produced Net releases beta
16 through 20; made the development snapshots; worked with Net
contributors to fix bugs; made many various code improvements himself;
wrote a paper on Cygwin for the 1998 Usenix NT Symposium; authored the
project WWW pages, FAQ, README; etc.  Geoffrey is not currently employed
by Red Hat.


<P>
Steve Chamberlain designed and implemented
Cygwin in 1995-1996 while working for Cygnus.  He worked with the Net
to improve the technology, ported/integrated many of the user tools
for the first time to Cygwin, and produced all of the releases up to
beta 14.  Steve is not currently employed by Red Hat.


<P>
Marco Fuykschot and Peter Boncz of Data Distilleries contributed nearly
all of the changes required to make Cygwin thread-safe.  They also
provided the pthreads interface.


<P>
Sergey Okhapkin has been an invaluable Net contributor.  He implemented
the tty/pty support, has played a significant role in revamping signal
and exception handling, and has made countless contributions throughout
the library.  He also provided binaries of the development snapshots to
the Net after the beta 19 release.


<P>
Mumit Khan has been most helpful on the EGCS end of things, providing
quite a large number of stabilizing patches to the compiler tools for
the B20 release.


<P>
Philippe Giacinti contributed the implementation of dlopen, dlclose,
dlsym, dlfork, and dlerror in Cygwin.


<P>
Ian Lance Taylor did a much-needed rework of the path handling code for
beta 18, and has made many assorted fixes throughout the code.  Jeremy
Allison made significant contributions in the area of file handling and
process control, and rewrote select from scratch.  Doug Evans rewrote
the path-handling code in beta 16, among other things.  Kim Knuttila and
Michael Meissner put in many long hours working on the now-defunct
PowerPC port.  Jason Molenda and Mark Eichin have also made important
contributions.


<P>
Please note that all of us working on Cygwin try to
be as responsive as possible and deal with patches and questions as we
get them, but realistically we don't have time to answer all of the
email that is sent to the main mailing list.  Making Net releases of the
Win32 tools and helping people on the Net out is not our primary job
function, so some email will have to go unanswered.


<P>
Many thanks to everyone using the tools for their many contributions in
the form of advice, bug reports, and code fixes.  Keep them coming!

<P>
Most of the tools are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL),
although some are public domain, and others have a X11-style
copyright.  To cover the GNU GPL requirements, the basic rule is if
you give out any binaries, you must also make the source available.
For the full details, be sure to read the text of the GNU GPL which
follows.


<P>
The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the source
code is also covered by the GNU GPL.  By default, all executables link
against this library (and in the process include GPL'd Cygwin glue
code).  This means that unless you modify the tools so that compiled
executables do not make use of the Cygwin library, your compiled
programs will also have to be free software distributed under the GPL
with source code available to all.


<P>
Cygwin is currently available for proprietary use only through a
proprietary-use license.  Please see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/</A></STRONG> for more information
about the Red Hat Cygwin Product.


<P>
In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat, Inc. permits
programs whose sources are distributed under a license that complies
with the Open Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without
libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the
GNU GPL.


<P>
This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the
cygwin DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of
the DLL you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e., you must
provide sources for the cygwin DLL.

		   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		      Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &#60;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&#62;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &#60;name of author&#62;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &#60;signature of Ty Coon&#62;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
