Microsoft Windows.  They run thanks to the Cygwin library which
provides the POSIX system calls and environment these programs expect.
</p><p>With these tools installed, it is possible to write Windows console
or GUI applications that make use of significant parts of the POSIX API.
As a result, it is possible to easily port many Unix programs without the need
for extensive changes to the source code.  This includes configuring
and building most of the available GNU software (including the packages
included with the Cygwin development tools themselves) as well as lots
of BSD tools and packages (including OpenSSH).  Even if
the development tools are of little to no use to you, you may have
interest in the many standard POSIX utilities provided with the package.
They can be used from one of the provided Unix shells like bash, tcsh or zsh,
as well as from the standard Windows command shell if you have to for some
sad reason.

(XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/2008 R2/8/2012).
Since Cygwin is a community-supported free software project, patches to
provide support for other versions would be thoughtfully considered.
Paid support contracts or enhancements are available through Red Hat.  For 
information about getting a Red Hat support contract, see

supports.  Because of this, Cygwin will behave differently, and
exhibit different limitations, on the various versions of Windows.

freedoms, so it is free software.

The Cygwin setup project is currently maintained by a group of people, most notably, Brian Dessent (brian) and Dave Korn (dave.korn).
</p><p>Please note that all of us working on Cygwin try to
be as responsive as possible and deal with patches and questions as we
get them, but realistically we don't have time to answer all of the
email that is sent to the main mailing list.  Making Net releases of the
Win32 tools and helping people on the Net out is not our primary job
function, so some email will have to go unanswered.
</p><p>Many thanks to everyone using the tools for their many contributions in
the form of advice, bug reports, and code fixes.  Keep them coming!

When you upgrade an existing older Cygwin installation to Cygwin 1.7, your old
system mount points (stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE branch of your registry)
are read by a script and the /etc/fstab file is generated from these entries. 
No such automatism exists for the user mount points formerly stored in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of the registry.  There's a bash script for your
convenience, which creates a user-specific /etc/fstab/${USER} file for you,

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>At the ``Select Packages'' screen, in ``Categories'' view, at the line 
marked ``All'', click on the word ``default'' so that it changes to

to install <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>, not just what it thinks you should have
by default.

There is no way to tell Cygwin Setup to install all packages by

editing the registry and restoring
<code class="literal">/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Lsa/Authentication Packages</code>
back to it's original value of <code class="literal">msv1_0</code>, and then rebooting.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete the Cygwin root folder and all subfolders.  If you get an error

closed all Cygwin programs.  If you get a 'Permission Denied' error then you 
will need to modify the permissions and/or ownership of the files or folders 
that are causing the error.  For example, sometimes files used by system 
services end up owned by the SYSTEM account and not writable by regular users.  
</p><p>The quickest way to delete the entire tree if you run into this problem is to 
change the ownership of all files and folders to your account.  To do this in 
Windows Explorer, right click on the root Cygwin folder, choose Properties, then 
the Security tab.  If you are using Windows XP Home or Simple File Sharing,
you will need to boot into Safe Mode to access the Security tab.  Select 
Advanced, then go to the Owner tab and make sure your account is listed as 
the owner.  Select the 'Replace owner on subcontainers and objects' checkbox 
and press Ok.  After Explorer applies the changes you should be able to 
delete the entire tree in one operation.  Note that you can also achieve 
this in Cygwin by typing <code class="literal">chown -R user /</code> or by using other 
tools such as <code class="literal">CACLS.EXE</code>. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete the Cygwin shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu, and
anything left by setup-x86{_64}.exe in the download directory.  However, if you
plan to reinstall Cygwin it's a good idea to keep your setup-x86{_64}.exe
download directory since you can reinstall the packages left in its cache
without redownloading them.

will have already removed everything important.  Typically only the installation

problems, or at the request of a Cygwin developer.
</p><p>You cannot use Cygwin Setup to install a snapshot.
</p><p>First, you will need to download the snapshot from the snapshots
page at <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/snapshots/" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/snapshots/</a>.  Note the directory where
you saved the snapshot tarball.
</p><p>Before installing a snapshot, you must first Close <span class="bold"><strong>all</strong></span> Cygwin
applications, including shells and services (e.g., <code class="literal">inetd</code>, <code class="literal">sshd</code>).
You will not be able to replace <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> if any Cygwin process is
running.  You may have to restart Windows to clear the DLL from memory
(beware of automatic service startup).
</p><p>Most of the downloaded snapshot can be installed using <code class="literal">tar</code>.  Cygwin
<code class="literal">tar</code> won't be able to update <code class="literal">/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll</code> (because it's
used by <code class="literal">tar</code> itself), but it should succeed with everything else.  If
you are only installing the DLL snapshot, skip the first tar command.  Open
a <code class="literal">bash</code> shell (it should be the only running Cygwin process) and issue
the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
	/bin/tar -C / -xvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.* --exclude=usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
	/bin/tar -C /tmp -xvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.* usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>
</p><p>Exit the bash shell, and use Explorer or the Windows command shell to
first rename <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> to
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</code> and then move
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\tmp\usr\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>
to <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> (assuming you installed Cygwin in
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin</code>).
</p><p>The operative word in trying the snapshots is "<span class="emphasis"><em>trying</em></span>".  If you
notice a problem with the snapshot that was not present in the release
DLL (what we call a "regression"), please report it to the Cygwin
mailing list (see <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/problems.html</a> for problem
reporting guidelines).  If you wish to go back to the older version of the
DLL, again, close all Cygwin processes, delete
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>, and
rename <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</code> back to
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> (again assuming that your "<code class="literal">/</code>" is
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin</code>).  To restore the rest of the snapshot
files, reinstall the "<code class="literal">cygwin</code>" package using Setup.

It depends on what you mean by "break".  If the application installs a

If the application installs an older version of the DLL in /bin then you

Remember that the Cygwin DLL strives to be backwards compatible so a
newer version of the DLL should always work with older executables.  So,
in general, it is always best to keep one version of the DLL on your
system and it should always be the latest version which matches your
installed distribution.

</p><p>Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</p><p>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</pre><p>
and
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /

for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.
</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Warning:</strong></span> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.
</p><p>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</pre><p>
Then <code class="literal">/cygdrive/c/Windows</code> becomes <code class="literal">/c/Windows</code> which is a
little less typing.
</p><p>Note that you have to enter the mount point into the
<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file to keep it indefinitely. 
The mount command will only add the mount point for the lifetime
of your current Cygwin session.
</p><p>You can change the default <code class="literal">cygdrive</code> prefix and whether it is binmode or textmode using the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file

Integrity Desktop, and the built-in firewall in Windows XP. Other
well-known products including ZoneAlarm and Norton Internet Security have
caused problems for some users but work fine for others. At last report,
Agnitum Outpost did not work with Cygwin.  If you are having strange
connection-related problems, disabling the firewall is a good
troubleshooting step (as is closing or disabling all other running
applications, especially resource-intensive processes such as indexed
search).
</p><p>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is used.  The few rare
exceptions have to do with socket code.
Cygwin uses sockets to implement many of its functions, such as IPC.
Some overzealous firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock
stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
throughout.  Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with examples
of poorly written firewall-type software that causes things to break.
Note that with many of these products, simply disabling the firewall
does not remove these changes; it must be completely uninstalled.

tell the difference between files with just different case, so the

</p><p>To help with this problem, Cygwin supports case sensitivity
starting with Cygwin 1.7.0.  For a detailed description how to use that

interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<code class="literal">aux.sh</code>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<code class="literal">aux.sh</code> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.

</pre><p>Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> know what you are doing.
</p><p>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.
</p><p>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.
</p><p>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <span class="emphasis"><em>So don't do this!</em></span>
</p><p>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.
(Maybe you have nothing like that installed now, but who knows about
things you might add in the future?)

If you want to be able to logon with domain accounts to a domain member
machine, you should make sure that the "cyg_server" account under which
the sshd service is usually running, is a domain account.  Otherwise you
might end up with weird problems.  For instance, sshd might fail to load
the child process when trying to login with a domain account.  A potential,
confirmed error message is
</p><pre class="screen">
  *** fatal error - unable to load user32.dll, Win32 error 1114
</pre><p>
Here's how you set up a sshd with a domain service account.
</p><p>
First of all, create a new domain account called "cyg_server".  This
account must be an administrative account, so make sure it's in the
"Administrators" group.  Now create a domain policy which is propagated
to all machines which are supposed to run an sshd service.  This domain
policy should give the following user rights to the "cyg_server" account:
</p><pre class="screen">
  Act as part of the operating system (SeTcbPrivilege)
  Create a token object               (SeCreateTokenPrivilege)
  Replace a process level token       (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)
</pre><p>
Now to install sshd on the member machine, logon to that machine as
an admin.  Make sure the aforementioend global policy has been propagated
to this machine.  Examine the Local Security Policy settings and, if
necessary, call gpupdate.
</p><p>
If everything looks ok, run bash.  Starting with Windows Vista, make
sure you're running bash elevated.
</p><p>
If "cyg_server" is not already in <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code>, add it
using <code class="literal">mkpasswd</code>.  Make sure all domain accounts which are
supposed to be able to logon via ssh are in <code class="literal">/etc/passwd</code>.
Also make sure that all important domain groups are in
<code class="literal">/etc/group</code>.  If in doubt, call
</p><pre class="screen">
  $ mkpasswd -l -d your_domain &gt; /etc/passwd
  $ mkgroup -l -d your_domain &gt; /etc/group
</pre><p>
Then run ssh-host-config.  Answer all questions so that "cyg_server" is
used to run the service.  When done, check ownership of
<code class="literal">/var/empty</code> and all <code class="literal">/etc/ssh*</code>
files.  All of them must be owned by "cyg_server".  If that's ok, you're
usually all set and you can start the sshd service via

Cygwin and Cygwin packages that seem to have no rational explanation.  Among
the most common symptoms they report are fork failures, memory leaks, and file
access denied problems.  These problems, when they have been traced, often appear
to be caused by interference from other software installed on the same PC.  Security
software, in particular, such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall applications,
often implements its functions by installing hooks into various parts of the system,
including both the Explorer shell and the underlying kernel.  Sometimes these hooks
are not implemented in an entirely transparent fashion, and cause changes in the
behaviour which affect the operation of other programs, such as Cygwin.
</p><p>Among the software that has been found to cause difficulties are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Sonic Solutions burning software containing DLA component (when DLA disabled)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Norton/McAfee/Symantec antivirus or antispyware</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Logitech webcam software with "Logitech process monitor" service</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Kerio, Agnitum or ZoneAlarm Personal Firewall</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Iolo System Mechanic/AntiVirus/Firewall</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>LanDesk</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Windows Defender </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Various programs by Wave Systems Corp using wxvault.dll, including Embassy Trust Suite and Embassy Security Center</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>NOD32 Antivirus</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ByteMobile laptop optimization client</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Earthlink Total-Access</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Spybot S&amp;D TeaTimer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>AR Soft RAM Disk</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ATI Catalyst (some versions)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>NVIDIA GeForce (some versions)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Windows LiveOneCare</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Webroot Spy Sweeper with Antivirus</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>COMODO Firewall Pro</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>PC Tools Spyware Doctor</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Avira AntiVir</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Panda Internet Security</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>BitDefender</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Google Desktop</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sophos Anti-Virus 7</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Bufferzone from Trustware</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Lenovo IPS Core Service (ipssvc)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Credant Guardian Shield</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>AVAST (disable FILESYSTEM and BEHAVIOR realtime shields)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Citrix Metaframe Presentation Server/XenApp (see <a class="ulink" href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX107825" target="_top">Citrix Support page</a>)</p></li></ul></div><p>Sometimes these problems can be worked around, by temporarily or partially
disabling the offending software.  For instance, it may be possible to disable
on-access scanning in your antivirus, or configure it to ignore files under the
Cygwin installation root.  Often, unfortunately, this is not possible; even disabling
the software may not work, since many applications that hook the operating system
leave their hooks installed when disabled, and simply set them into what is intended
to be a completely transparent pass-through mode.  Sometimes this pass-through is not
as transparent as all that, and the hooks still interfere with Cygwin; in these cases,
it may be necessary to uninstall the software altogether to restore normal operation.
</p><p>Some of the symptoms you may experience are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Random fork() failures.</p><p>Caused by hook DLLs that load themselves into every process in the
system.  POSIX fork() semantics require that the memory map of the child process
must be an exact duplicate of the parent process' layout.  If one of these DLLs
loads itself at a different base address in the child's memory space as compared
to the address it was loaded at in the parent, it can end up taking the space that
belonged to a different DLL in the parent.  When Cygwin can't load the original
DLL at that same address in the child, the fork() call has to fail.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>File access problems.</p><p>Some programs (e.g., virus scanners with on-access scanning) scan or
otherwise operate on every file accessed by all the other software running on
your computer.  In some cases they may retain an open handle on the file even
after the software that is really using the file has closed it.  This has been
known to cause operations such as deletes, renames and moves to fail with
access denied errors.  In extreme cases it has been known for scanners to leak
file handles, leading to kernel memory starvation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Networking issues</p><p>Firewall software sometimes gets a bit funny about Cygwin.  It's not
currently understood why; Cygwin only uses the standard Winsock2 API, but
perhaps in some less-commonly used fashion that doesn't get as well tested
by the publishers of firewalls.  Symptoms include mysterious failures to
connect, or corruption of network data being sent or received.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Memory and/or handle leaks</p><p>Some applications that hook into the Windows operating system exhibit
bugs when interacting with Cygwin that cause them to leak allocated memory
or other system resources.  Symptoms include complaints about out-of-memory
errors and even virtual memory exhaustion dialog boxes from the O/S; it is
often possible to see the excess memory allocation using a tool such as
Task Manager or Sysinternals' Process Explorer, although interpreting the
statistics they present is not always straightforward owing to complications
such as virtual memory paging and file caching.</p></li></ul></div></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a name="faq.using.fixing-fork-failures"></a><a name="idm243309059248"></a><p><b>4.43.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>How do I fix <code class="literal">fork()</code> failures?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Unfortunately, Windows does not use the fork/exec model of process creation

</p><p>On POSIX systems, a file is a file and what the file contains is
whatever the program/programmer/user told it to put into it.  In Windows,
a file is also a file and what the file contains depends not only on the
program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode.
</p><p>When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially.  A \n (new line, NL) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return, CR) so that if you `printf("Hello\n") you in fact get
"Hello\r\n".  Upon reading this combination, the \r is removed and the
number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less than was actually read.
This tends to confuse programs dependent on ftell() and fseek().  A
Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even
though it truly isn't the end of file.
</p><p>One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to mix Cygwin-ported
POSIX programs with generic Windows programs.  As a result, Cygwin allows
to open files in text mode.  In the accompanying tools, tools that deal
with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in POSIX binary mode and many (but
not all) tools that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in text mode.
There are also some text tools which operate in a mixed mode.  They read
files always in text mode, but write files in binary mode, or they write
in the mode (text or binary) which is specified by the underlying mount
point.  For a description of mount points, see the Cygwin User's Guide.
</p><p>Actually there's no really good reason to do text mode processing
since it only slows down reading and writing files.  Additionally many
Windows applications can deal with POSIX \n line endings just fine
(unfortunate exception: Notepad).  So we suggest to use binary mode
as much as possible and only convert files from or to DOS text mode
using tools specifically created to do that job, for instance, d2u and
u2d from the cygutils package.
</p><p>It is rather easy for the porter of a Unix package to fix the source
code by supplying the appropriate file processing mode switches to the
open/fopen functions.  Treat all text files as text and treat all binary
files as binary.  To be specific, you can select binary mode by adding
<code class="literal">O_BINARY</code> to the second argument of an
<code class="literal">open</code> call, or <code class="literal">"b"</code> to second argument
of an <code class="literal">fopen</code> call.  You can also call
<code class="literal">setmode (fd, O_BINARY)</code>.  To select text mode add
<code class="literal">O_TEXT</code> to the second argument of an <code class="literal">open</code>
call, or <code class="literal">"t"</code> to second argument of an
<code class="literal">fopen</code> call, or just call
<code class="literal">setmode (fd, O_TEXT)</code>.
</p><p>You can also avoid to change the source code at all by linking
an additional object file to your executable.  Cygwin provides various
object files in the <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code> directory which,
when linked to an executable, changes the default open modes of any
file opened within the executed process itself.  The files are
</p><pre class="screen">
  binmode.o      - Open all files in binary mode.
  textmode.o     - Open all files in text mode.
  textreadmode.o - Open all files opened for reading in text mode.
  automode.o     - Open all files opened for reading in text mode,
                   all files opened for writing in binary mode.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
  Linking against these object files does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> change
  the open mode of files propagated to a process by its parent process,
  for instance, if the process is part of a shell pipe expression.
</div><p>
</p><p>Note that of the above flags only the "b" fopen flags are defined by
ANSI.  They exist under most flavors of Unix.  However, using O_BINARY,
O_TEXT, or the "t" flag is non-portable.

of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do).  Because of this it
can be a little slow.  In most cases, you are better off using the
spawn family of calls if possible.
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><p>Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself.  Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks).  Parent fills in the child's
.data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into
the suspended child's address space.  Parent then starts the child.
Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.  Child starts and
discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump
buffer.  Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on
another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap.  Parent
notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into
child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the
fork call.  Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped
areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.

</p><p>The default method generates link files with a magic header.  When you
open a file or directory that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file
or directory listed in the magic header.  Because we don't want to have to
open every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin marks symlinks
with the system attribute.  Files without the system attribute are not
checked.  Because remote samba filesystems do not enable the system
attribute by default, symlinks do not work on network drives unless you
explicitly enable this attribute or use the second method to create symlinks.
</p><p>The second method is enabled if `winsymlinks' is set in the environment
variable CYGWIN.
Using this method, Cygwin generates symlinks by creating Windows shortcuts.
Cygwin created shortcuts have a special header (which is in that way never
created by Explorer) and the R/O attribute set.  A DOS path is stored in
the shortcut as usual and the description entry is used to store the POSIX
path.  While the POSIX path is stored as is, the DOS path has perhaps to be
rearranged to result in a valid path.  This may result in a divergence
between the DOS and the POSIX path when symlinks are moved crossing mount
points.  When a user changes the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin
and it will only use the DOS path then.  While Cygwin shortcuts are shown
without the ".lnk" suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin shortcuts are shown
with the suffix.  However, both are treated as symlinks.
</p><p>Both, types of symlinks can live peacefully together since Cygwin
treats both as symlinks regardless of the setting of `(no)winsymlinks' in
the environment variable CYGWIN.

shared library.  First of all, since October 1998 every Cygwin DLL has
been named <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> and has a 1 in the release name.
Additionally, there are DLL major and minor numbers that correspond to
the name of the release, and a release number. In other words,
cygwin-1.7.1-2 is <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code>, major version 7, minor
version 1, release 2.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> major version number gets incremented
only when a change is made that makes existing software incompatible. For
example, the first major version 5 release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added 64-bit
file I/O operations, which required many libraries to be recompiled and
relinked.  The minor version changes every time we make a new backward
compatible Cygwin release available.  There is also a
<code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> release version number.  The release number
is only incremented if we update an existing release in a way that does not
effect the DLL (like a missing header file).
</p><p>There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.  The major number
tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to the API.
An executable linked with an earlier major number will not be compatible
with the latest DLL.  The minor number tracks significant API additions
or changes that will not break older executables but may be required by
newly compiled ones.
</p><p>Then there is a shared memory region compatibility version number.  It is
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared memory
region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.  For more exciting
Cygwin version number details, check out the

<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLP64#64-bit_data_models" target="_top">LP64</a>
data model.  That means, in contrast to Windows, which uses an
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLP64#64-bit_data_models" target="_top">LLP64</a>
data model, sizeof(long) != sizeof(int), just as on Linux.</p><p>For comparison:</p><pre class="screen">
                 Cygwin   Windows  Cygwin
                 Linux    x86_64   Linux
                 Windows           x86_64
                 i686

sizeof(size_t)      4        8        8
sizeof(void*)       4        8        8
</pre><p>This difference can result in interesting problems, especially when
using Win32 functions, especially when using pointers to Windows
datatypes like LONG, ULONG, DWORD.  Given that Windows is LLP64, all of
the aforementioned types are 4 byte in size, on 32 as well as on 64 bit
Windows, while `long' on 64 bit Cygwin is 8 bytes.</p><p>Take the example ReadFile:</p><pre class="screen">
  ReadFile (HANDLE, LPVOID, DWORD, LPDWORD, LPOVERLAPPED);
</pre><p>In the 32 bit Cygwin and Mingw environments, as well as in the 64 bit
Mingw environment, it is no problem to substitute DWORD with unsigned
long:</p><pre class="screen">
  unsigned long number_of_bytes_read;
  [...]
  ReadFile (fhdl, buf, buflen, &amp;number_of_bytes_read, NULL);
</pre><p>However, in 64 bit Cygwin, using LP64, number_of_bytes_read is 8 bytes
in size.  But since ReadFile expects a pointer to a 4 byte type, the function
will only change the lower 4 bytes of number_of_bytes_read on return, while
the content of the upper 4 bytes stays undefined.</p><p>Here are a few <span class="emphasis"><em>donts</em></span> which should help porting
applications from the known ILP32 data model of 32 bit Cygwin, to the LP64
data model of 64 bit Cygwin.  Note that these are not Cygwin-only problems.
Many Linux applications suffered the same somewhat liberal handling of
datatypes when the AMD64 CPU was new.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> mix up int and long in printf/scanf.  This:

</p><pre class="screen">
    int i; long l;
    printf ("%d %ld\n", l, i);
</pre><p>

may not print what you think it should.  Enable the gcc options -Wformat or
-Wall, which warn about type mismatches in printf/scanf functions.

</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>Using -Wall (optionally with -Werror to drive the point home) makes a
lot of sense in general, not only when porting code to a new platform.</div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> mix int and long pointers.

</p><pre class="screen">
    long *long_ptr = (long *) &amp;my_int; /* Uh oh! */
    *long_ptr = 42;
</pre><p>

The assignment will write 8 bytes to the address of my_int.  Since my_int
is only 4 bytes, <span class="emphasis"><em>something else</em></span> gets randomly overwritten.
Finding this kind of bug is very hard, because you will often see a problem
which has no immediate connection to the actual bug.
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> mix int and pointers at all!  This will
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> work as expected anymore:

</p><pre class="screen">
    void *ptr;
    printf ("Pointer value is %x\n", ptr);
</pre><p>

%x denotes an int argument.  The value printed by printf is a 4 byte value,
so on x86_64 the printed pointer value is missing its upper 4 bytes; the output
is very likely wrong.  Use %p instead, which portable across architectures:

</p><pre class="screen">
    void *ptr;
    printf ("Pointer value is %p\n", ptr);
</pre><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
Along the same lines <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> use the type int in
pointer arithmetic.  Don't cast pointers to int, don't cast pointer
differences to int, and don't store pointer differences in an int type.
Use the types <code class="literal">intptr_t</code>, <code class="literal">uintptr_t</code>
and <code class="literal">ptrdiff_t</code> instead, they are designed for performing
architecture-independent pointer arithmetic.
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> make blind assumptions about the size of a POSIX
type.  For instance, <code class="literal">time_t</code> is 8 bytes on 64 bit Cygwin,
while it is (still, at the time of writing this) 4 bytes on 32 bit Cygwin,
since time_t is based on the type long.
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> use functions returning pointers without declaration.
For instance

</p><pre class="screen">
    printf ("Error message is: %s\n", strerror (errno));
</pre><p>

This code will <span class="emphasis"><em>crash</em></span>, unless you included
<code class="filename">string.h</code>.  The implicit rule in C is that an undeclared
function is of type int.  But int is 4 byte and pointers are 8 byte, so the
string pointer given to printf is missing the upper 4 bytes.
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> use C base types together with Win32 functions.
Keep in mind that DWORD, LONG, ULONG are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same
as long and unsigned long.  Try to use only Win32 datatypes in conjunction
with Win32 API function calls to avoid type problems.  See the above
ReadFile example.  Windows functions in printf calls should be treated
carefully as well.  This code is common for 32 bit code, but probably prints
the wrong value on 64 bit:

</p><pre class="screen">
    printf ("Error message is: %lu\n", GetLastError ());
</pre><p>

Using gcc's -Wformat option would warn about this.  Casting to the requested
base type helps in this case:

</p><pre class="screen">
    printf ("Error message is: %lu\n", (unsigned long) GetLastError ());
</pre><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span> mix Windows datatypes with POSIX type-specific
MIN/MAX values.

</p><pre class="screen">
    unsigned long l_max = ULONG_MAX;    /* That's right. */
    ULONG w32_biggest = ULONG_MAX;	/* Hey, wait!  What? */
    ULONG w32_biggest = UINT_MAX;	/* Ok, but borderline. */
</pre><p>

Again, keep in mind that ULONG (or DWORD) is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> unsigned
long but rather unsigned int on 64 bit.

To circumvent this, mount the path of the executable using the -X switch

causes cygwin executables to talk directly to one another, which increases
the command-line limit. To enable cygexec for <code class="literal">/bin</code> and

for whatever Win32 API functions that you are going to use, with the exception
of kernel32, which is linked automatically (because the startup and/or
built-in code uses it).
</p><p>For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you must link
with gdi32 like this:
</p><p>gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32
</p><p>or (compiling and linking in one step):
</p><p>gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32
</p><p>The regular setup allows you to use the option -mwindows on the
command line to include a set of the basic libraries (and also
make your program a GUI program instead of a console program),
including user32, gdi32 and comdlg32.
</p><p>It is a good idea to put import libraries last on your link line,
or at least after all the object files and static libraries that reference them.

installed; you at least need <code class="literal">gcc-g++</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>,
<code class="literal">perl</code>, <code class="literal">cocom</code>, <code class="literal">gettext</code>,
and <code class="literal">zlib-devel</code>.
Building for 32-bit Cygwin also requires <code class="literal">libiconv</code>,
<code class="literal">mingw64-i686-gcc-g++</code>, <code class="literal">mingw64-i686-zlib</code>,
and <code class="literal">mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core</code>.
Building for 64-bit Cygwin also requires <code class="literal">libiconv-devel</code>,
<code class="literal">mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++</code>, and
<code class="literal">mingw64-x86_64-zlib</code>.
If you want to run the tests, <code class="literal">dejagnu</code> is also required.
Normally, building ignores any errors in building the documentation,
which requires the <code class="literal">dblatex</code>,
<code class="literal">docbook-xml45</code>, <code class="literal">docbook-xsl</code>, and
<code class="literal">xmlto</code> packages.  For more information on building the
documentation, see the README included in the <code class="literal">cygwin-doc</code> package.
</p><p>Next, get the Cygwin source.  Ideally, you should check out
what you need from CVS (<a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/cvs.html" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/cvs.html</a>).  This is the
<span class="emphasis"><em>preferred method</em></span> for acquiring the sources.  Otherwise, if
you are trying to duplicate a cygwin release then you should 
download the corresponding source package
(<code class="literal">cygwin-x.y.z-n-src.tar.bz2</code>). </p><p>You <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> build cygwin in a separate directory from
the source, so create something like a <code class="literal">build/</code> directory.
Assuming you checked out the source in <code class="literal">/oss/src/</code>, and you
also want to install to the temporary location <code class="literal">install</code>:
</p><pre class="screen">
mkdir /oss/build
mkdir /oss/install 
cd build
(/oss/src/configure --prefix=/oss/install -v; make) &gt;&amp; make.out
make install &gt; install.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>
If the build works, install everything <span class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> the dll (if
you can).  Then, close down all cygwin programs (including bash windows,
inetd, etc.), save your old dll, and copy the new dll to the correct
place.  Then start up a bash window, or  run a cygwin program from the
Windows command prompt, and see what happens.
</p><p>If you get the error "shared region is corrupted" it means that two
different versions of cygwin1.dll are running on your machine at the
same time. Remove all but one.

</p><p>You must execute the following sequence of five commands, in this
order:
</p><pre class="screen">
$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
        --base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE EXPFILE -dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
	--base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) EXPFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY
</pre><p>In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld.
</p><p>$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool.
</p><p>$(AS) is the assembler, as.
</p><p>DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create, e.g., tcl80.dll.
</p><p>OBJS is the list of object files you want to put into the DLL.
</p><p>LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the DLL against.  For
example, you may or may not want -lcygwin.  You may want -lkernel32.
</p><p>DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file.  A simple DEFFILE would
consist of ``EXPORTS'' followed by a list of all symbols which should
be exported from the DLL.  Each symbol should be on a line by itself.
Other programs will only be able to access the listed symbols.
</p><p>BASEFILE is a temporary file that is used during this five stage
process, e.g., tcl.base.
</p><p>EXPFILE is another temporary file, e.g., tcl.exp.
</p><p>ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to use as the entry
point.  This function should be defined using the WINAPI attribute,
and should take three arguments:
        int WINAPI startup (HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID)
</p><p>This means that the actual symbol name will have an appended @12, so if
your entry point really is named <code class="literal">startup</code>, the string you should
use for ENTRY in the above examples would be <code class="literal">startup@12</code>.
</p><p>If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the entry function will need
to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer.  You can do that by declaring
a global variable <code class="literal">_impure_ptr</code>, and then initializing it in the
entry function.  Be careful not to export the global variable
<code class="literal">_impure_ptr</code> from your DLL; that is, do not put it in DEFFILE.
</p><pre class="screen">
/* This is a global variable.  */
struct _reent *_impure_ptr;
extern struct _reent *__imp_reent_data;

int entry (HINSTANT hinst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)
{
  _impure_ptr = __imp_reent_data;
  /* Whatever else you want to do.  */
}
</pre><p>You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines.
Note that if you specify a --subsytem &lt;x&gt; flag to ld,
the -e entry must come after the subsystem flag, since the subsystem flag
sets a different default entry point.
</p><p>You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on the $(LD) lines.
This will set the default image base.  Programs using this DLL will
start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a different portion of the
address space.  Each DLL starts at the image base, and continues for
whatever size it occupies.
</p><p>Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to build a library so
that other programs can link against it.  This is not required: you
could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary.  However, if you want to be
able to link directly against the DLL, you need to create a library.
Do that like this:
</p><p>$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE --output-lib LIBFILE
</p><p>$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same as above.  Make
sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or things won't work right.
</p><p>LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to create, e.g.,
libtcl80.a.  You can then link against that library using something
like -ltcl80 in your linker command.

say, you will run into serious problems if your malloc is buggy.

bash, the DLL will try and expand the wildcards on the command line.
This process uses <code class="literal">malloc</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> your main line is started.
If you have written your own <code class="literal">malloc</code> to need some initialization
to occur after <code class="literal">main</code> is called, then this will surely break.
</p><p>Moreover, there is an outstanding issue with <code class="literal">_malloc_r</code> in
<code class="literal">newlib</code>.  This re-entrant version of <code class="literal">malloc</code> will be called
directly from within <code class="literal">newlib</code>, by-passing your custom version, and
is probably incompatible with it.  But it may not be possible to replace
<code class="literal">_malloc_r</code> too, because <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> does not export it and
Cygwin does not expect your program to replace it.  This is really a
newlib issue, but we are open to suggestions on how to deal with it.
