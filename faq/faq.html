<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="faq.html#TOC1">What is it?</A></H1>

<P>
The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools
for Windows NT, 95, and 98.  They run thanks to the Cygwin library which
provides the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect.


<P>
With these tools installed, it is possible to write Win32 console or
GUI applications that make use of the standard Microsoft Win32 API
and/or the Cygwin API.  As a result, it is possible to easily
port many significant Unix programs without the need
for extensive changes to the source code.  This includes configuring
and building most of the available GNU software (including the packages
included with the Cygwin development tools themselves).  Even if
the development tools are of little to no use to you, you may have
interest in the many standard Unix utilities provided with the package.
They can be used both from the bash shell (provided) or from the
standard Windows command shell.




<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="faq.html#TOC2">Where can I get it?</A></H2>

<P>
The main WWW page for the Cygwin project is
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a></TT>.  There you should find
everything you need for Cygwin, including links for download and setup,
a current list of ftp mirror sites, a User's Guide, an API Reference,
mailing lists and archives, and additional ported software.


<P>
You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.fsf.org/manual/">http://www.fsf.org/manual/</a></TT>.  (You should read GNU manuals from a
local mirror.  Check <TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html">http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html</a></TT>
for a list of them.)




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="faq.html#TOC3">Is it free software?</A></H2>

<P>
Yes.  Parts are GNU software (gcc, gas, ld, etc...), parts are covered
by the standard X11 license, some of it is public domain, some of
it was written by Cygnus and placed under the GPL.  None of it is
shareware.  You don't have to pay anyone to use it but you should be
sure to read the copyright section of the FAQ more more information on
how the GNU General Public License may affect your use of these tools.


<P>
In particular, if you intend to port a proprietary (non-GPL'd)
application using Cygwin, you will need the proprietary-use license 
for the Cygwin library.  This is available for purchase; please
contact sales@cygnus.com for more information.
All other questions should be sent to the project
mailing list cygwin@sources.redhat.com.


<P>
Note that when we say "free" we mean freedom, not price.  The goal of
such freedom is that the people who use a given piece of software
should be able to change it to fit their needs, learn from it, share
it with their friends, etc.  The Cygwin license allows you those
freedoms, so it is free software.


<P>
The Cygwin 1.0 product was a "commercial" distribution of cygwin.  As
such, it included such non-software things as printed manuals, support,
and aggregation of useful utilities.  There was nothing (software-wise)
in there that you couldn't get off the net already, if you took the time
to find and download everything (and usually, build it yourself),
although the <EM>versions</EM> available for download may have beeen
different than those distributed with the commercial product.  We tested
it all to make sure it worked together, and packaged it in a convenient
form.  We considered such testing and packaging to be a valuable service
and thus charged a fee for it.  Plus, it provided income for the cygwin
project so we could continue working on it.  However, Red Hat is no
longer offering Cygwin 1.0 on CD.  There are tentative plans to offer a
new Cygwin CD sometime in early 2001.  So far, however, there are no
definite plans.  The latest news about this can be found at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-cd.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-cd.html</a></TT>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="faq.html#TOC4">Recent history of the project: What version <EM>is</EM> this, anyway?</A></H2>

<P>
Starting on April 17, 2000, the Cygwin team changed the procedure for
doing net releases.


<P>
Previously, net releases entailed downloading one or two large files
(called something like <CODE>FULL.EXE</CODE> or <CODE>USER.EXE</CODE>).  These files
unpacked a "Cygwin Distribution" to a static (and arcane) directory
structure.  This distribution contained lots of .exe, .a, .h, and other
files.


<P>
These distributions were named after the version of the Cygwin DLL which
they contained.  The last version released with this method was Cygwin
B20.1.


<P>
This distribution method has the advantage that everything was "all in
one place".  You could copy the huge FULL.EXE file around and know that
you were getting the complete "Cygwin Distribution".


<P>
The method had several disadvantages, however.  1) it was huge, 2) it
was hard to download in one error-free piece, and 3) it was hard to
update.


<P>
Why was it hard to update?  Because any change to any package in
FULL.EXE meant re-generating all of FULL.EXE.  This process was not easy
to automate since FULL.EXE was an InstallShield executable.  As a
result, until recently, Cygwin development was relatively static.


<P>
To rectify these problems, the Cygwin team decided, early in January
2000, to break up the packages in the release and make a small program
(<CODE>setup.exe</CODE>) available to use in downloading packages.  After much
development and internal discussion on the cygwin-developers mailing
list, the new, improved version of a Cygwin release was made available
on April 17, 2000.


<P>
This new release also had a new version of the Cygwin DLL -- 1.1.0.
Most of the other packages were updated and some packages from the
Cygwin CD were included.  Meanwhile, the Cygwin DLL continues to be
updated, and is more generically referred to as "1.1.x".


<P>
Users obtain this package by first downloading a version of
<CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.  This program started as a simple command line tool,
has metamorphosed into a GUI, and is in the process of continual
improvement.  However, its purpose is simple -- it is designed to
install packages from the cygwin web site at sources.redhat.com.  In
effect, it is a smaller, more intelligent replacement for FULL.EXE.  It
does not require the downloading a huge executable but rather downloads
individual small packages.


<P>
Does this mean that the new net release of the Cygwin package is 1.1.x?
No.  We no longer label the releases with the Cygwin version number.
Each package in the cygwin release has its own version now.


<P>
Does this mean that Cygwin 1.1.x is newer than B20.1?  Yes!  The cygwin
1.1.x versions all represent continual improvement in the Cygwin DLL.
Although the 1.1.x code is still considered "beta quality", the Cygwin
team felt comfortable enough with the cygwin technology to bump the
version number to "1".


<P>
The other packages in the latest directory are also continually
improving, some thanks to the efforts of net volunteers who maintain the
cygwin binary ports.  Each package has its own version numbers and
its own release process.


<P>
So, how do you get the most up-to-date version of cygwin?  Easy.  Just
download the setup.exe program from your closest mirror.  This program
will handle the task of updating the packages on your system to the
latest version.  The Cygwin team frequently updates and adds new
packages to the soureware web site.  The setup.exe program is the
easiest way to determine what you need on your system.


<P>
For some "ancient" history of the project (rather, just woefully out of
date), visit the Project History page at

<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="faq.html#TOC6">Contents</A></H2>

<P>
Unlike previous net releases such as B20.1 and earlier, there is no
monolithic "full" or "usertools" installation.  Rather, you can pick and
choose the packages you wish to install, and update them individually.


<P>
The following packages are available with the current release, in their
respective directories:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`latest'</SAMP>
<DD>
ash bash binutils bison byacc bzip2 clear common crypt cygwin dejagnu
diff expect fileutils findutils flex gawk gcc gdb gperf grep groff gzip
inetutils less login m4 make man mt opengl openssh openssl patch sed
shellutils tar tcltk termcap texinfo textutils time vim

<DT><SAMP>`contrib'</SAMP>
<DD>
cvs gdbm jbigkit jpeg libpng tiff zlib

</DL>

<P>
Full source code is available for all packages and tools.


<P>
There is one recommended way to install Cygwin, which is to use the GUI
installer <SAMP>`setup.exe'</SAMP>.  There are some variations on how you go
about that.


<P>
Do it any other way, and you're on your own!  That said, keep in mind
that the GUI installer is a "work in progress", so there might be a few
difficulties, especially if you are behind a firewall or have other
specific requirements.  If something doesn't work right for you, and
it's not covered here or elsewhere, then by all means report it to the
mailing list.




<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="faq.html#TOC7">Installation using the <SAMP>`setup.exe'</SAMP> program</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>IMPORTANT: First read the README file in the <SAMP>`latest'</SAMP>
directory at any ftp mirror.  DO THIS NOW!  Information in the README
file is not repeated here.  You can find a mirror site near you from
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html</a></TT>.</STRONG>


<P>
The <SAMP>`setup.exe'</SAMP> program is the recommended way to install Cygwin,
but it is still a work in progress.  Expect features and functionality
to change.  For this reason, it is a good idea to note the version and
build time reported by <CODE>setup.exe</CODE> when you run it.  This will help
diagnose problems, should you have any.  Check the cygwin mailing list
for the latest news about <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="faq.html#TOC8">Why not install in C:\?</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>setup.exe</CODE> program will prompt you for a "root" directory.
The default is <SAMP>`C:\cygwin'</SAMP>, but you can change it.  You are urged not to
choose something like 'C:\' (the root directory on the system drive) for
your Cygwin root.  If you do, then critical Cygwin system directories
like 'etc', 'lib' and 'bin' could easily be corrupted by other (non-Cygwin)
applications or packages that use \etc, \lib or \bin.  Perhaps there is
no conflict now, but who knows what you might install in the future?
It's also just good common sense to segregate your Cygwin "filesystems"
from the rest of your Windows system disk.  (In the past, there had been
genuine bugs that would cause problems for people who installed in C:\,
but we believe those are gone now.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="faq.html#TOC9">Can I use the new setup to update a B18, B19, B20, B20.1 or CD-ROM (1.0) installation of Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
No, you must start from scratch with the new setup.  The overall
structure has changed so much that it would be silly to try to
accomodate old installations of Cygwin.  You'll probably be much better
off with a whole new installation anyway.  You may backup or rename your
old installation first, or just install the new one somewhere else.  Be
sure to make note of your current mount table, because this will be
overwritten during the new setup.


<P>
Once you've installed the latest net release, the new setup will update
just the individual packages that need it.




<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="faq.html#TOC10">The README says I should turn off anti-virus software.  Isn't that dangerous?</A></H3>

<P>
Only Network Associates (formerly McAfee) products have been reported to
"hang" when extracting Cygwin tar archives.  Other products have been
reported to detect false positives in Cygwin files.  Depending on how
your anti-virus software is configured, it may then delete the file(s)
without prompting you.  Any problems will depend on the particular
engine and/or signature file in use, and possibly other factors.  If you
don't mind <EM>this</EM> risk, then just leave your anti-virus software
running.


<P>
Otherwise, you can download <CODE>setup.exe</CODE> and scan it.  Then turn off
the anti-virus software, then run setup to download and extract all the
tar files.  Then re-activate your anti-virus software and scan
everything in C:\cygwin (or wherever you chose to install).  This should
be safe, as long as nobody substitutes a malicious <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>!




<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="faq.html#TOC11">What packages should I download?</A></H3>

<P>
Just get everything, if you have room for it.  But if you must be
selective:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`cygwin'</SAMP>
<DD>
This is the minimum core, consisting of the cygwin1.dll and a few
commands (like <CODE>mount</CODE>).  Not much else, and no shell!

<DT><SAMP>`bash'</SAMP>
<DD>
This is the default interactive command shell for cygwin.  If you don't
install <SAMP>`bash'</SAMP>, then the "Cygwin Bash Shell" shortcut that setup
creates for you won't actually do anything.

<DT><SAMP>`ash'</SAMP>
<DD>
This is often forgotten because it's not obvious that <SAMP>`ash'</SAMP>
contains <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>, which is essential for running scripts (and
<SAMP>`make'</SAMP> and ...).

</DL>

<P>
If you want to build programs, of course you'll need <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>, but
you'll also need <SAMP>`binutils'</SAMP>, probably <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`fileutils'</SAMP>, and possibly lots more.  (Again, consider just getting
everything!)




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="faq.html#TOC12">What if setup fails?</A></H3>

<P>
First, make sure that you are using the latest version of
<CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.  It's a work in progress, with improvements and
bugfixes being made often.  The latest version is always available from
the 'Install Cygwin now' link on the Cygwin Home Page at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a></TT>.


<P>
If you are downloading from the internet, setup will fail if it cannot
download the list of mirrors at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html</a></TT>.  It could be that
the network is too busy.  Similarly for an ftp download site that isn't
working.  Try another mirror, or try again later.


<P>
If setup refuses to download a package that you know needs to be
upgraded, try deleting that package's entry from /etc/setup.  If you are
reacting quickly to an announcement on the mailing list, it could be
that the mirror you are using doesn't have the latest copy yet.  Try
another mirror, or try again tomorrow.


<P>
If setup has otherwise behaved strangely, check the files
<SAMP>`setup.log'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`setup.log.full'</SAMP> in the Cygwin root directory
(<CODE>C:\cygwin</CODE> by default).  It may provide some clues as to what
went wrong and why.


<P>
If you're still baffled, search the Cygwin mailing list for clues.
Others may have the same problem, and a solution may be posted there.
If that search proves fruitless, send a query to the Cygwin mailing
list.  You must provide complete details in your query: version of
setup, options you selected, contents of setup.log and setup.log.full,
what happened that wasn't supposed to happen, etc.




<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="faq.html#TOC13">What's the difference between packages in <SAMP>`latest'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`contrib'</SAMP>?</A></H3>

<P>
Good question!  That very issue has been debated on the
<SAMP>`cygwin-apps'</SAMP> mailing list.  Check the list archives if you want to
know more.  Start at <TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html</a></TT>.


<P>
In any case, there is no distinction as far as <CODE>setup.exe</CODE> is
concerned.  It should install all packages from both <CODE>latest</CODE> and
<CODE>contrib</CODE> directories.




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="faq.html#TOC14">My Windows logon name has a space in it, will this cause problems?</A></H3>

<P>
Most definitely yes!  UNIX shells (and thus Cygwin) use the space
character as a word delimiter.  Under certain circumstances, it is
possible to get around this with various shell quoting mechanisms, but
you are much better off if you can avoid the problem entirely.


<P>
In particular, the environment variables <SAMP>`USER'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`HOME'</SAMP> are
set for you in /etc/profile.  By default these derive from your Windows
logon name.  You may edit this file and set them explicitly to something
without spaces.


<P>
(If you use the <SAMP>`login'</SAMP> package or anything else that reads
/etc/passwd, you may need to make corresponding changes there.  See the
README file for that package.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="faq.html#TOC15">How do I uninstall Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Setup has no automatic uninstall facility.  Just delete everything
manually:



<UL>
<LI>Cygwin shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu

<LI>The registry tree <SAMP>`Software\Cygnus Solutions'</SAMP> under

<CODE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</CODE> and/or <CODE>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</CODE>.

<LI>Anything under the Cygwin root folder, <SAMP>`C:\cygwin'</SAMP> by

default.

<LI>Anything created by setup in its temporary working directory.

</UL>

<P>
It's up to you to deal with other changes you made to your system, such
as installing the inetd service, altering system paths, etc.  Setup
would not have done any of these things for you.


<H1><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="faq.html#TOC16">What Unix API calls are supported by Cygwin?</A></H1>

<P>
This is the beginning of documentation listing the calls supported
by the Cygwin library.


<P>
All POSIX.1/1996 and ANSI C calls are listed in this file.  Note that
while almost all POSIX.1/1990 calls are included in Cygwin, most
POSIX.1/1996 calls are not (yet at least!).  Additional Unix
compatibility calls and extended libc/libm calls are provided by
Cygwin but may or may not be listed yet.


<P>
To see if a function is implemented but not listed here, check for the
presence of the call in the file winsup/cygwin.din in the sources.  In
addition, you may want to read the source code corresponding to the call
to verify that it is not a stub.  Finally, libc/libm functions
(including extended calls not listed here) may be documented in the
newlib texinfo documentation.


<P>
Calls are implemented on both Windows 95 and NT unless otherwise
noted.  Included are references to relevant standards, if any.
Calls starting with "cygwin_" are Cygwin-specific calls.

<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="faq.html#TOC22">Where's the documentation?</A></H3>

<P>
There are links to quite a lot of it on the main Cygwin project web
page: <TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a></TT>.  Be sure to at least
read any 'Release Notes' or 'Readme' or 'read this' links on the main
web page, if there are any.


<P>
There is a comprehensive Cygwin User's Guide at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html</a></TT>
and an API Reference at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html</a></TT>.


<P>
There is an interesting paper about Cygwin from the 1998 USENIX Windows
NT Workshop Proceedings at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/usenix-98/cygwin.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/usenix-98/cygwin.html</a></TT>.


<P>
You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.fsf.org/manual/">http://www.fsf.org/manual/</a></TT>.  (You should read GNU manuals from a
local mirror, check <TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html">http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html</a></TT>
for a list of them.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="faq.html#TOC23">What Cygwin mailing lists can I join?</A></H3>

<P>
Comprehensive information about the Cygwin mailing lists can be found at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/lists.html</a></TT>.


<P>
To subscribe to the main list, send a message to
cygwin-subscribe@sources.redhat.com.  To unsubscribe from the 
main list, send a message to cygwin-unsubscribe@sources.redhat.com.
In both cases, the subject and body of the message are ignored.


<P>
Similarly, to subscribe to the Cygwin annoucements list, send a message
to cygwin-announce-subscribe@sources.redhat.com.  To unsubscribe,
send a message to cygwin-announce-unsubscribe@sources.redhat.com.


<P>
If you are going to help develop the Cygwin library by volunteering for
the project, you will want to subscribe to the Cygwin developers list,
called cygwin-developers.  If you are contributing to Cygwin tools &#38;
applications, rather than the library itself, then you should subscribe
to cygwin-apps.  The same mechanism as described for the first two lists
works for these as well.  Both cygwin-developers and cygwin-apps are
by-approval lists.


<P>
There is a searchable archive of the main mailing list at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/</a></TT>.  There is an alternate
archive, also searchable, at <TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.delorie.com/archives/">http://www.delorie.com/archives/</a></TT>.


<P>
Cygwin mailing lists are not gatewayed to USENET, so anti-spam measures
in your email address are neither required nor appreciated.  Also, avoid
sending HTML content to Cygwin mailing lists.




<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="faq.html#TOC24">Posting Guidelines (Or: Why won't you/the mailing list answer my questions?)</A></H3>

<P>
If you follow these guidelines, you are much more likely to get a
helpful response from the Cygwin developers and/or the Cygwin community at
large:



<UL>
<LI>Read the User's Guide and the FAQ first.

<LI>Check the mailing list archives.  Your topic may have come up

before.  (It may even have been answered!)  Use the search facilities
at the links above.  Try the alternate site if the main archive is not
producing search results.
<LI>Explain your problem carefully and completely.  "I installed Blah

and it doesn't work!" wastes everybody's time.  It provides no
information for anyone to help you with your problem.  You should
provide:


<UL>
<LI>A problem statement:  How does it behave, how do you think it

should behave, and what makes you think it's broken?  (Oh yeah, and what
is <EM>"it"</EM>?)
<LI>Information about your Windows OS ("Win95 OSR2" or "NT4/SP3" or

"Win2K" or "Win98 SE" or ...).
<LI>Details about your installation process, or attempts at same.  (Internet or

Directory install?  If the former, exactly when and from what mirror?
If the latter, which packages did you download?  Which version of
setup.exe?  Any subsequent updates?)
<LI>Details about your Cygwin setup, accomplished by <EM>pasting</EM>

the output of 'cygcheck -s -v -r' into your message.  (Do not send the
output as a file attachment.)
<LI>A valid return address, so that a reply doesn't require manual editing of

the 'To:' header.
</UL>

<LI>Your message must be relevant to the list.  Messages that are

<EM>not</EM> directly related to Cygwin are considered off-topic and are
unwelcome.  For example, the following are off-topic:


<UL>
<LI>General programming language questions

<LI>General Windows programming questions

<LI>General UNIX shell programming questions

<LI>General application usage questions

<LI>How to make millions by working at home

<LI>Announcements from LaserJet toner cartridge suppliers

</UL>

</UL>

<P>
If you do not follow the above guidelines, you may still elicit a
response, but you may not appreciate it!


<P>
Inquiries about support contracts and commercial licensing should go to
info@cygnus.com.  If you want to purchase the Cygwin 1.0 CD-ROM, visit
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/">http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/</a></TT> or write to
cygwin-info@cygnus.com.  While not strictly <EM>unappreciated</EM> in the
main cygwin list, you'll get the information you need more quickly if
you write to the correct address in the first place.


<P>
Beyond that, perhaps nobody has time to answer your question.  Perhaps
nobody knows the answer.




<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="faq.html#TOC25">Using Cygwin</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="faq.html#TOC26">How should I set my PATH?</A></H3>

<P>
If you look at the "Cygwin 1.1.0" (or similar) shortcut created in the
"Cygnus Solutions" programs folder, you'll see that it runs
<CODE>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin.bat</CODE> (assuming your root is
<CODE>C:\cygwin</CODE>).  The contents should look something like this:



<PRE>
	@echo off
	SET MAKE_MODE=unix
	SET PATH=C:\cygwin\bin;C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin;%PATH%
	bash
</PRE>

<P>
Effectively, this <STRONG>prepends</STRONG> /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin to your
Windows system path.  If you choose to reset your PATH, say in
$HOME/.bashrc, then you should follow this rule.  You <STRONG>must</STRONG> have
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> in your PATH <STRONG>before</STRONG> any Windows system
directories.  (And you must not omit the Windows system directories!)
Otherwise you will likely encounter all sorts of problems
running Cygwin applications.


<P>
If you haven't messed up the default mounts, then <CODE>/bin</CODE> and
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> are the same location, so you only need one of them in
your PATH.  You should use <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> for installing
additional Cygwin applications that are not part of the core net
release.  (That is, anything not found in an ftp mirror of <CODE>latest</CODE>
and installed by <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="faq.html#TOC27">How do I convert between Windows and UNIX paths?</A></H3>

<P>
Use the 'cygpath' utility.  Type '<CODE>cygpath</CODE>' with no arguments to
get usage information.  For example (on my installation):

<PRE>
	bash$ cygpath --windows ~/.bashrc
        D:\starksb\.bashrc
        bash$ cygpath --unix C:/cygwin/bin/cygwin.bat
        /usr/bin/cygwin.bat
        bash$ cygpath --unix C:\\cygwin\\bin\\cygwin.bat
        /usr/bin/cygwin.bat
</PRE>

<P>
Note that bash interprets the backslash '\' as an escape character, so
you must type it twice in the bash shell if you want it to be recognised
as such.




<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="faq.html#TOC28">Why doesn't bash read my .bashrc file on startup?</A></H3>

<P>
Your .bashrc is read from your home directory specified by the HOME
environment variable.  It uses /.bashrc if HOME is not set.  So you need
to set HOME correctly, or move your .bashrc to the top of the drive
mounted as / in Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="faq.html#TOC29">How can I get bash filename completion to be case insensitive?</A></H3>

<P>
"shopt -s nocaseglob" should do the trick.




<H3><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="faq.html#TOC30">Can I use paths/filenames containing spaces in them?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths.  That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix.  If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in filenames
used by Cygwin tools.


<P>
In particular, bash interprets space as a word separator.  You would have
to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space character.
For example:

<PRE>
	bash-2.03$ cd '/cygdrive/c/Program Files'
</PRE>

<P>
or

<PRE>
	bash-2.03$ cd /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="faq.html#TOC31">Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a directory?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin does not follow MS Windows Explorer Shortcuts (*.lnk files).  It
sees a shortcut as a regular file and this you cannot "cd" into it.


<P>
Some people have suggested replacing the current symbolic link scheme
with shortcuts.  The major problem with this is that .LNK files would
then be used to symlink Cygwin paths that may or may not be valid
under native Win32 non-Cygwin applications such as Explorer.




<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="faq.html#TOC32">I'm having basic problems with find.  Why?</A></H3>

<P>
Make sure you are using the find that came with Cygwin and that you
aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead.  You can verify that
you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.




<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="faq.html#TOC33">Why doesn't man work?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="faq.html#TOC35">Why don't cursor keys work under Win95/Win98?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
Careful examination shows that they not just non-functional, but
rather behave strangely, for example, with NumLock off, keys on numeric
keyboard work, until you press usual cursor keys, when even numeric
stop working, but they start working again after hitting alphanumeric
key, etc. This reported to happen on localized versions of Win98 and
Win95, and not specific to Cygwin (there're known cases of Alt+Enter
(fullscreen/windowed toggle) not working and shifts sticking with
other programs). The cause of this problem is Microsoft keyboard
localizer which by default installed in 'autoexec.bat'. Corresponding
line looks like:



<PRE>
keyb ru,,C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\keybrd3.sys
</PRE>

<P>
(That's for russian locale.) You should comment that line if you want
your keys working properly. Of course, this will deprive you of your
local alphabet keyboard support, so you should think about
another localizer. exUSSR users are of course knowledgable of Keyrus
localizer, and it might work for other locales too, since it has keyboard
layout editor. But it has russian messages and documentation ;-(
Reference URL is http://www.hnet.ru/software/contrib/Utils/KeyRus/
(note the you may need to turn off Windows logo for Keyrus to operate
properly).




<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="faq.html#TOC36">Is it OK to have multiple copies of the DLL?</A></H3>

<P>
You should only have one copy of the Cygwin DLL on your system.  If you
have multiple versions, they will conflict and cause problems.


<P>
If you get the error "shared region is corrupted" it means you have
multiple versions of cygwin1.dll running at the same time.  This could
happen, for example, if you update cygwin1.dll without exiting <EM>all</EM>
Cygwin apps (including inetd) beforehand.




<H3><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="faq.html#TOC37">Where can I find "more"?</A></H3>

<P>
If you are looking for the "more" pager, you should use the "less" pager
instead.




<H3><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="faq.html#TOC38">Where can I find "which"?</A></H3>

<P>
There is no "which" command with Cygwin.  However, you can use the bash
shell builtin "type" which does something similar.




<H3><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="faq.html#TOC39">How can I access other drives?</A></H3>

<P>
You have some flexibility here.


<P>
Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.


<P>
In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&#60;drive&#62;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:

<PRE>
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</PRE>

<P>
and

<PRE>
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /
</PRE>

<P>
for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.


<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behaviour of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.


<P>
You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:

<PRE>
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</PRE>

<P>
Then <SAMP>`/cygdrive/c/Windows'</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>`/c/Windows'</SAMP> which is a
little less typing.


<P>
Note that you only need to mount drives once.  The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely.
You can only get rid of them with umount, or the registry editor.


<P>
The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode
("binmode") where text and binary files are treated equivalently.  This
should only be necessary for badly ported Unix programs where binary
flags are missing from open calls.  It is also the setting for /,
/usr/bin and /usr/lib in a default Cygwin installation.  The default for
new mounts is text mode ("textmode"), which is also the mode for all
"cygdrive" mounts.


<P>
You can change the default <SAMP>`cygdrive'</SAMP> prefix and whether it is
binmode or textmode using the <CODE>mount</CODE> command.  For example,

<PRE>
	bash$ mount -b --change-cygdrive-prefix cygdrive
</PRE>

<P>
will change all <CODE>/cygdrive/...</CODE> mounts to binmode.




<H3><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="faq.html#TOC40">How can I copy and paste into Cygwin console windows?</A></H3>

<P>
Under Windows NT, open the properties dialog of the console window.
The options contain a toggle button, named "Quick edit mode".  It must
be ON.  Save the properties.


<P>
Under Windows 9x, open the properties dialog of the console window.
Select the Misc tab.  Uncheck Fast Pasting.  Check QuickEdit.




<H3><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="faq.html#TOC41">What does "mount failed: Device or resource busy" mean?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
This usually means that you are trying to mount to a location
already in use by mount.  For example, if c: is mounted as '/'
and you try to mount d: there as well, you will get this error
message.  First "umount" the old location, then "mount" the new one and
you should have better luck.


<P>
If you are trying to umount '/' and are getting this message, you may
need to run <CODE>regedit.exe</CODE> and change the "native" key for the '/'
mount in one of the mount points kept under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Cygnus Solutions/CYGWIN.DLL setup/&#60;version&#62;
where &#60;version&#62; is the latest registry version associated with the
Cygwin library.




<H3><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="faq.html#TOC42">How can I share files between Unix and Windows?</A></H3>

<P>
During development, we have both Unix boxes running Samba and
NT/Windows 95/98 machines.  We often build with cross-compilers
under Unix and copy binaries and source to the Windows system
or just toy with them directly off the Samba-mounted partition.
On dual-boot NT/Windows 9x machines, we usually use the FAT
filesystem so we can also access the files under Windows 9x.




<H3><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="faq.html#TOC43">Are mixed-case filenames possible with Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case.  A prime example
of this is perl's configuration script, which wants <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and
<CODE>makefile</CODE>.  WIN32 can't tell the difference between files with
just different case, so the configuration fails.


<P>
In releases prior to beta 16, mount had a special mixed case option
which renamed files in such a way as to allow mixed case filenames.  We
chose to remove the support when we rewrote the path handling code for
beta 16.  The standard Windows apps -- explorer.exe,
cmd.exe/command.com, etc. -- do not distinguish filenames that differed
only in case, resulting in some (very) undesirable behavior.


<P>
Sergey Okhapkin had maintained a mixed-case patch ('coolview') until
about B20.1, but this has not been updated to recent versions of Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="faq.html#TOC44">What about DOS special filenames?</A></H3>

<P>
Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either as
the root filename or as the extension part.  If you do, you'll have
trouble.  Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<CODE>aux.sh</CODE> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.




<H3><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="faq.html#TOC45">When it hangs, how do I get it back?</A></H3>

<P>
If something goes wrong and the tools hang on you for some reason (easy
to do if you try and read a file called aux.sh), first try hitting ^C to
return to bash or the cmd prompt.


<P>
If you start up another shell, and applications don't run, it's a good
bet that the hung process is still running somewhere.  Use the Task
Manager, pview, or a similar utility to kill the process.


<P>
And, if all else fails, there's always the reset button/power switch.
This should never be necessary under Windows NT.




<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="faq.html#TOC46">Why the weird directory structure?</A></H3>

<P>
Why do /lib and /usr/lib (and /bin, /usr/bin) point to the same thing?


<P>
Why use mounts instead of symbolic links?


<P>
Can I use a disk root (e.g., C:\) as Cygwin root?  Why is this discouraged?


<P>
After a new installation in the default location, your mount points will
look something like this:



<PRE>
Device              Directory           Type         Flags
C:\cygwin\bin       /usr/bin            user         binmode
C:\cygwin\lib       /usr/lib            user         binmode
C:\cygwin           /                   user         binmode
</PRE>

<P>
Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <EM>really</EM> know what you are doing.


<P>
Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.


<P>
Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.


<P>
Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <EM>So don't do this!</EM>


<P>
It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.
(Maybe you have nothing like that installed now, but who knows about
things you might add in the future?)




<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="faq.html#TOC47">How do anti-virus programs like Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
Users have reported that NAI (formerly McAfee) VirusScan for NT (and
others?) is incompatible with Cygwin.  This is because it tries to scan
the newly loaded shared memory in cygwin1.dll, which can cause fork() to
fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools.  (It is not confirmed that
this is still a problem, however.)


<P>
There have been several reports of NAI VirusScan causing the system to
hang when unpacking tar.gz archives.  This is surely a bug in VirusScan,
and should be reported to NAI.  The only workaround is to disable
VirusScan when accessing these files.  This can be an issue during
setup, and is discussed in that FAQ entry.


<P>
Some users report a significant performance hit using Cygwin when their
anti-virus software is enabled.  Rather than disable the anti-virus
software completely, it may be possible to specify directories whose
contents are exempt from scanning.  In a default installation, this
would be <SAMP>`<CODE>C:\cygwin\bin</CODE>'</SAMP>.  Obviously, this could be
exploited by a hostile non-Cygwin program, so do this at your own risk.




<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="faq.html#TOC48">Why can't I run bash as a shell under NT Emacs?</A></H3>

<P>
The Windows port of GNU Emacs (aka "NT emacs") uses the Windows command
shell by default.  Also, since Emacs is not a Cygwin application, it has
no knowledge of Cygwin mounts.  With those points in mind, you need to
add the following code to your ~/.emacs or ~/_emacs file in order to use

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
"Out of queue slots!" generally occurs when you're trying to remove
many files that you do not have permission to remove (either because
you don't have permission, they are opened exclusively, etc).  What
happens is Cygwin queues up these files with the supposition that it
will be possible to delete these files in the future.  Assuming that
the permission of an affected file does change later on, the file will
be deleted as requested.  However, if too many requests come in to
delete inaccessible files, the queue overflows and you get the message
you're asking about.  Usually you can remedy this with a quick chmod,
close of a file, or other such thing.  (Thanks to Larry Hall for
this explanation).

<H3><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="faq.html#TOC55">How does everything work?</A></H3>

<P>
There's a C library which provides a Unix-style API.  The
applications are linked with it and voila - they run on Windows.


<P>
The aim is to add all the goop necessary to make your apps run on
Windows into the C library.  Then your apps should run on Unix and
Windows with no changes at the source level.


<P>
The C library is in a DLL, which makes basic applications quite small.
And it allows relatively easy upgrades to the Win32/Unix translation
layer, providing that dll changes stay backward-compatible.


<P>
For a good overview of Cygwin, you may want to read the paper on Cygwin

<H3><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="faq.html#TOC57">How is the DOS/Unix CR/LF thing handled?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
Let's start with some background.


<P>
In UNIX, a file is a file and what the file contains is whatever the
program/programmer/user told it to put into it.  In Windows, a file is
also a file and what the file contains depends not only on the
program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode.


<P>
When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially.  A \n (new line) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return) so that if you `printf("Hello\n") you in fact get
"Hello\r\n".  Upon reading this combination, the \r is removed and the
number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less than was actually read.
This tends to confuse programs dependant on ftell() and fseek().  A
Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even
though it truly isn't the end of file.


<P>
One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to easily mix Cygwin-ported
Unix programs with generic Windows programs.  As a result, Cygwin opens
files in text mode as is normal under Windows.  In the accompanying
tools, tools that deal with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in unix
binary mode and tools that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in
text mode.


<P>
Some people push the notion of globally setting the default processing
mode to binary via mount point options or by setting the CYGWIN32
environment variable.  But that creates a different problem.  In
binary mode, the program receives all of the data in the file, including
a \r.  Since the programs will no longer deal with these properly for
you, you would have to remove the \r from the relevant text files,
especially scripts and startup resource files.  This is a porter "cop
out", forcing the user to deal with the \r for the porter.


<P>
It is rather easy for the porter to fix the source code by supplying the
appropriate file processing mode switches to the open/fopen functions.
Treat all text files as text and treat all binary files as binary.
To be specific, you can select binary mode by adding <CODE>O_BINARY</CODE> to
the second argument of an <CODE>open</CODE> call, or <CODE>"b"</CODE> to second
argument of an <CODE>fopen</CODE> call.  You can also call <CODE>setmode (fd,
O_BINARY)</CODE>.


<P>
Note that because the open/fopen switches are defined by ANSI, they
exist under most flavors of Unix; open/fopen will just ignore the switch
since they have no meaning to UNIX.


<P>
Also note that <CODE>lseek</CODE> only works in binary mode.

<P>
But seriously, Windows 9x lacks most of the security-related calls and
has several other deficiencies with respect to its version of the Win32
API.  See the calls.texinfo document for more information as to what
is not supported in Win 9x.




<H3><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="faq.html#TOC60">How is fork() implemented?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin fork() essentially works like a non-copy on write version
of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do).  Because of this it
can be a little slow.  In most cases, you are better off using the
spawn family of calls if possible.


<P>
Here's how it works:


<P>
Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself.  Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks).  Parent fills in the childs
.data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into
the suspended child's address space.  Parent then starts the child.
Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.  Child starts and
discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump
buffer.  Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on
another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap.  Parent
notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into
child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the
fork call.  Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped
areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.




<H3><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="faq.html#TOC61">How does wildcarding (globbing) work?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
If an application using CYGWIN.DLL starts up, and can't find the
<CODE>PID</CODE> environment variable, it assumes that it has been started
from the a DOS style command prompt.  This is pretty safe, since the
rest of the tools (including bash) set PID so that a new process knows
what PID it has when it starts up.


<P>
If the DLL thinks it has come from a DOS style prompt, it runs a
`globber' over the arguments provided on the command line.  This means
that if you type <CODE>LS *.EXE</CODE> from DOS, it will do what you might
expect.


<P>
Beware: globbing uses <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  If your application defines
<CODE>malloc</CODE>, that will get used.  This may do horrible things to you.




<H3><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="faq.html#TOC62">How do symbolic links work?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin generates link files with a magic header.  When
you open a file or directory that is a link to somewhere else, it
opens the file or directory listed in the magic header.  Because we
don't want to have to open every referenced file to check symlink
status, Cygwin marks symlinks with the system attribute.  Files
without the system attribute are not checked.  Because remote samba
filesystems do not enable the system attribute by default, symlinks do
not work on network drives unless you explicitly enable this
attribute.




<H3><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="faq.html#TOC63">Why do some files, which are not executables have the 'x' type.</A></H3>

<P>
When working out the unix-style attribute bits on a file, the library
has to fill out some information not provided by the WIN32 API.  


<P>
It guesses that files ending in .exe and .bat are executable, as are
ones which have a "#!" as their first characters.




<H3><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="faq.html#TOC64">How secure is Cygwin in a multi-user environment?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin is not secure in a multi-user environment.  For
example if you have a long running daemon such as "inetd"
running as admin while ordinary users are logged in, or if
you have a user logged in remotely while another user is logged
into the console, one cygwin client can trick another into
running code for it.  In this way one user may gain the
priveledge of another cygwin program running on the machine.
This is because cygwin has shared state that is accessible by 
all processes.


<P>
(Thanks to Tim Newsham (newsham@lava.net) for this explanation).




<H3><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="faq.html#TOC65">How do the net-related functions work?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
The network support in Cygwin is supposed to provide the Unix API, not
the Winsock API.


<P>
There are differences between the semantics of functions with the same
name under the API.


<P>
E.g., the select system call on Unix can wait on a standard file handles
and handles to sockets.  The select call in winsock can only wait on
sockets.  Because of this, cygwin.dll does a lot of nasty stuff behind
the scenes, trying to persuade various winsock/win32 functions to do what
a Unix select would do.


<P>
If you are porting an application which already uses Winsock, then
using the net support in Cygwin is wrong.


<P>
But you can still use native Winsock, and use Cygwin.  The functions
which cygwin.dll exports are called 'cygwin_&#60;name&#62;'.  There
are a load of defines which map the standard Unix names to the names
exported by the dll -- check out include/netdb.h:



<PRE>
..etc..
void		cygwin_setprotoent (int);
void		cygwin_setservent (int);
void		cygwin_setrpcent (int);
..etc..
#ifndef __INSIDE_CYGWIN_NET__
#define endprotoent cygwin_endprotoent 
#define endservent cygwin_endservent 
#define endrpcent  cygwin_endrpcent  
..etc..
</PRE>

<P>
The idea is that you'll get the Unix-&#62;Cygwin mapping if you include
the standard Unix header files.  If you use this, you won't need to
link with libwinsock.a - all the net stuff is inside the dll.


<P>
The mywinsock.h file is a standard winsock.h which has been hacked to
remove the bits which conflict with the standard Unix API, or are
defined in other headers.  E.g., in mywinsock.h, the definition of
struct hostent is removed.  This is because on a Unix box, it lives in
netdb.  It isn't a good idea to use it in your applications.


<P>
As of the b19 release, this information may be slightly out of date.




<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="faq.html#TOC66">I don't want Unix sockets, how do I use normal Win32 winsock?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
To use the vanilla Win32 winsock, you just need to #define Win32_Winsock
and #include "windows.h" at the top of your source file(s).  You'll also
want to add -lwsock32 to the compiler's command line so you link against
libwsock32.a.




<H3><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="faq.html#TOC67">What version numbers are associated with Cygwin?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
There is a cygwin.dll major version number that gets incremented
every time we make a new Cygwin release available.  This
corresponds to the name of the release (e.g. beta 19's major
number is "19").  There is also a cygwin.dll minor version number.  If
we release an update of the library for an existing release, the minor
number would be incremented.


<P>
There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.  The major number
tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to the API.
An executable linked with an earlier major number will not be compatible
with the latest DLL.  The minor number tracks significant API additions
or changes that will not break older executables but may be required by
newly compiled ones.


<P>
Then there is a shared memory region compatibity version number.  It is
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared memory
region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.


<P>
Finally there is a mount point registry version number which keeps track
of non-backwards-compatible changes to the registry mount table layout.
This has been "B15.0" since the beta 15 release.

<H3><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="faq.html#TOC69">Is there a mouse interface?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="faq.html#TOC71">Why are compiled executables so huge?!?</A></H3>

<P>
By default, gcc compiles in all symbols.  You'll also find that gcc
creates large executables on UNIX.


<P>
If that bothers you, just use the 'strip' program, part of the binutils
package.  Or compile with the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option to gcc.




<H3><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="faq.html#TOC72">Where is glibc?</A></H3>

<P>
Cygwin does not provide glibc.  It uses newlib instead, which provides
much (but not all) of the same functionality.  Porting glibc to Cygwin
would be difficult.




<H3><A NAME="SEC73" HREF="faq.html#TOC73">Why is make behaving badly?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
Starting with the beta 19 release, make defaults to a win32 mode in
which backslashes in filenames are permitted and cmd.exe/command.com
is used as the sub-shell.  In this mode, escape characters aren't
allowed among other restrictions.  For this reason, you must set
the environment variable MAKE_MODE to UNIX to run make on ordinary Unix
Makefiles.  Here is the full scoop:


<P>
MAKE_MODE selects between native Win32 make mode (the default) and
a Unix mode where it behaves like a Unix make.  The Unix mode does
allow specifying Win32-style paths but only containing forward slashes
as the path separator.  The path list separator character is a colon
in Unix mode.


<P>
Win32 mode expects path separators to be either / or \.  Thus no
Unix-style \s as escape are allowed.  Win32 mode also uses
cmd.exe/command.com as the subshell which means "copy" and "del"
(and other shell builtins) will work.  The path list separator
character is semi-colon in Win32 mode.  People who want an nmake-like
make might want to use this mode but no one should expect Unix
Makefiles to compile in this mode.  That is why the default b19
install sets MAKE_MODE to UNIX.

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
It's pretty simple actually.  Cygwin tools require that you explicitly
link the import libraries for whatever Win32 API functions that you
are going to use, with the exception of kernel32, which is linked
automatically (because the startup and/or built-in code uses it).


<P>
For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you must link
with gdi32 like this:


<P>
gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32


<P>
or (compiling and linking in one step):


<P>
gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32


<P>
The following libraries are available for use in this way:


<P>
advapi32  largeint  ole32     scrnsave  vfw32
cap       lz32      oleaut32  shell32   win32spl
comctl32  mapi32    oledlg    snmp      winmm
comdlg32  mfcuia32  olepro32  svrapi    winserve
ctl3d32   mgmtapi   opengl32  tapi32    winspool
dlcapi    mpr       penwin32  th32      winstrm
gdi32     msacm32   pkpd32    thunk32   wow32
glaux     nddeapi   rasapi32  url       wsock32
glu32     netapi32  rpcdce4   user32    wst
icmp      odbc32    rpcndr    uuid
imm32     odbccp32  rpcns4    vdmdbg
kernel32  oldnames  rpcrt4    version


<P>
The regular setup allows you to use the option -mwindows on the
command line to include a set of the basic libraries (and also
make your program a GUI program instead of a console program),
including user32, gdi32 and, IIRC, comdlg32.


<P>
Note that you should never include -lkernel32 on your link line
unless you are invoking ld directly.  Do not include the same import
library twice on your link line.  Finally, it is a good idea to
put import libraries last on your link line, or at least after
all the object files and static libraries that reference them.


<P>
The first two are related to problems the linker has (as of b18 at least)
when import libraries are referenced twice.  Tables get messed up and
programs crash randomly.  The last point has to do with the fact that
gcc processes the files listed on the command line in sequence and
will only resolve references to libraries if they are given after
the file that makes the reference.




<H3><A NAME="SEC76" HREF="faq.html#TOC76">How do I compile a Win32 executable that doesn't use Cygwin?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="faq.html#TOC79">Why does make complain about a "missing separator"?</A></H3>

Subsection 2.d.f of the `Microsoft Open Tools License agreement' looks
like it says that one may not "permit further redistribution of the
Redistributables to their end users".  We take this to mean that we can
give them to you, but you can't give them to anyone else, which is
something that Cygnus (err... Red Hat) can't agree to.  Fortunately, we

<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest

<P>
1. Build a C file with a function table.  Put all functions you intend

<P>
You must execute the following sequence of five commands, in this
order:



<PRE>
$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
        --base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE EXPFILE -dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
	--base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) EXPFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld.


<P>
$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool.


<P>
$(AS) is the assembler, as.


<P>
DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create, e.g., tcl80.dll.


<P>
OBJS is the list of object files you want to put into the DLL.


<P>
LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the DLL against.  For
example, you may or may not want -lcygwin.  You may want -lkernel32.
Tcl links against -lcygwin -ladvapi32 -luser32 -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32
-lkernel32.


<P>
DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file.  A simple DEFFILE would
consist of "EXPORTS" followed by a list of all symbols which should
be exported from the DLL.  Each symbol should be on a line by itself.
Other programs will only be able to access the listed symbols.


<P>
BASEFILE is a temporary file that is used during this five stage
process, e.g., tcl.base.


<P>
EXPFILE is another temporary file, e.g., tcl.exp.


<P>
ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to use as the entry
point.  This function should be defined using the WINAPI attribute,
and should take three arguments:
        int WINAPI startup (HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID)


<P>
This means that the actual symbol name will have an appended @12, so if
your entry point really is named <SAMP>`startup'</SAMP>, the string you should
use for ENTRY in the above examples would be <SAMP>`startup@12'</SAMP>.


<P>
If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the entry function will need
to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer.  You can do that by declaring
a global variable <SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP>, and then initializing it in the
entry function.  Be careful not to export the global variable
<SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP> from your DLL; that is, do not put it in DEFFILE.



<PRE>
/* This is a global variable.  */
struct _reent *_impure_ptr;
extern struct _reent *__imp_reent_data;

int entry (HINSTANT hinst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)
{
  _impure_ptr = __imp_reent_data;
  /* Whatever else you want to do.  */
}
</PRE>

<P>
You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines.  The
Tcl build does this, but I admit that I no longer remember whether
this is important.  Note that if you specify a --subsytem &#60;x&#62; flag to ld,
the -e entry must come after the subsystem flag, since the subsystem flag
sets a different default entry point.


<P>
You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on the $(LD) lines.
This will set the default image base.  Programs using this DLL will
start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a different portion of the
address space.  Each DLL starts at the image base, and continues for
whatever size it occupies.


<P>
Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to build a library so
that other programs can link against it.  This is not required: you
could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary.  However, if you want to be
able to link directly against the DLL, you need to create a library.
Do that like this:


<P>
$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE --output-lib LIBFILE


<P>
$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same as above.  Make
sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or things won't work right.


<P>
LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to create, e.g.,
libtcl80.a.  You can then link against that library using something
like -ltcl80 in your linker command.




<H3><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="faq.html#TOC90">How can I debug what's going on?</A></H3>

<P>
You can debug your application using <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  Make sure you

MS dlls, gdb will complain about not being able to load debug information
for them when you run your program.  This is normal since these dlls
don't contain debugging information (and even if they did, that debug
info would not be compatible with gdb).




<H3><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="faq.html#TOC91">Can I use a system trace mechanism instead?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes.  You can use the <CODE>strace.exe</CODE> utility to run other cygwin
programs with various debug and trace messages enabled.  For information
on using <CODE>strace</CODE>, see the Cygwin User's Guide or the file
<CODE>winsup/utils/utils.sgml</CODE>.


<P>
Alternatively, you can set the <CODE>STRACE</CODE> environment variable to
<CODE>1</CODE>, and get a whole load of debug information on your screen
whenever a Cygwin app runs.  This is an especially useful tool to use
when tracking bugs down inside the Cygwin library.  <CODE>STRACE</CODE> can be
set to different values to achieve different amounts of granularity.
You can set it to <CODE>0x10</CODE> for information about syscalls or
<CODE>0x800</CODE> for signal/process handling-related info, to name two.  The
strace mechanism is well documented in the Cygwin library sources in the
file <CODE>winsup/cygwin/include/sys/strace.h</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="faq.html#TOC92">Why doesn't gdb handle signals?</A></H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, there is only minimal signal handling support in gdb
currently.  Signal handling only works with Windows-type signals.
SIGINT may work, SIGFPE may work, SIGSEGV definitely does.  You cannot
'stop', 'print' or 'nopass' signals like SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP to the
process being debugged.

<P>
Include stdlib.h instead of malloc.h.




<H3><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="faq.html#TOC97">Can I use my own malloc?</A></H3>

<P>
If you define a function called <CODE>malloc</CODE> in your own code, and link
with the DLL, the DLL <EM>will</EM> call your <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  Needless to
say, you will run into serious problems if your malloc is buggy.


<P>
If you run any programs from the DOS command prompt, rather than from in
bash, the DLL will try and expand the wildcards on the command line.
This process uses <CODE>malloc</CODE> <EM>before</EM> your main line is started.
If you have written your own <CODE>malloc</CODE> to need some initialization
to occur after <CODE>main</CODE> is called, then this will surely break.


<P>
Moreover, there is an outstanding issue with <CODE>_malloc_r</CODE> in
<CODE>newlib</CODE>.  This re-entrant version of <CODE>malloc</CODE> will be called
directly from within <CODE>newlib</CODE>, by-passing your custom version, and
is probably incompatible with it.  But it may not be possible to replace
<CODE>_malloc_r</CODE> too, because <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> does not export it and
Cygwin does not expect your program to replace it.  This is really a
newlib issue, but we are open to suggestions on how to deal with it.




<H3><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="faq.html#TOC98">Can I mix objects compiled with msvc++ and gcc?</A></H3>

<P>
Yes, but only if you are combining C object files.  MSVC C++ uses a

<H3><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="faq.html#TOC99">Can I use the gdb debugger to debug programs built by VC++?</A></H3>

No, not for full (high level source language) debugging.
The Microsoft compilers generate a different type of debugging
symbol information, which gdb does not understand.


<P>
However, the low-level (assembly-type) symbols generated by
Microsoft compilers are coff, which gdb DOES understand.
Therefore you should at least be able to see all of your

<H3><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="faq.html#TOC104">How should I port my Unix GUI to Windows?</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
There are two basic strategies for porting Unix GUIs to Windows.


<P>
The first is to use a portable graphics library such as tcl/tk, X11, or
V (and others?).  Typically, you will end up with a GUI on Windows that
requires some runtime support.  With tcl/tk, you'll want to include the
necessary library files and the tcl/tk DLLs.  In the case of X11, you'll
need everyone using your program to have an X11 server installed.


<P>
The second method is to rewrite your GUI using Win32 API calls (or MFC
with VC++).  If your program is written in a fairly modular fashion, you
may still want to use Cygwin if your program contains a lot of shared
(non-GUI-related) code.  That way you still gain some of the portability
advantages inherent in using Cygwin.




<H3><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="faq.html#TOC105">Why not use DJGPP ?</A></H3>

<P>
DJGPP is a similar idea, but for DOS instead of Win32.  DJGPP uses a
"DOS extender" to provide a more reasonable operating interface for its
applications.   The Cygwin toolset doesn't have to do this since all of
the applications are native WIN32.   Applications compiled with the
Cygwin tools can access the Win32 API functions, so you can write
programs which use the Windows GUI.

<H2><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="faq.html#TOC111">Release Beta 20.1 (Dec 4 1998)</A></H2>

<P>
This is a bug fix update to the Beta 20 release.


<P>
The main change is an improved version of the Cygwin library although
there are also a couple of other minor changes to the tools.




<H3><A NAME="SEC112" HREF="faq.html#TOC112">Changes in specific tools:</A></H3>

<P>
The "-mno-cygwin" flag to gcc now include the correct headers.  In 20.0,
it included the Cygwin headers which was incorrect.


<P>
The "-pipe" flag to gcc works correctly now.


<P>
The cygcheck program now reassures users that not finding cpp is the
correct behavior.


<P>
The "-b" flag to md5sum can now be used to generate correct checksums
of binary files.


<P>
The libtermcap library has been added to the compiler tools sources.
It is the new source of the termcap library and /etc/termcap file.


<P>
The less pager (using libtermcap) has been added to the binary
distribution.




<H3><A NAME="SEC113" HREF="faq.html#TOC113">Changes in the Cygwin API (cygwin.dll):</A></H3>

<P>
This version of Cygwin is backwards-compatible with the beta 20 and 19
releases.  The library is now much more stable under Windows 9x and the
bugs affecting configures under 9x (and NT to a lesser extent) have
also been fixed.


<P>
The bug that made it necessary to start the value of the CYGWIN
environment variable with two leading spaces has been fixed.


<P>
The serial support in the select call has been fixed.


<P>
Handling of DLLs loaded by non-cygwin apps has been improved.  Bugs in
dlopen have been fixed.


<P>
Passing _SC_CHILD_MAX to the sysconf function now yields CHILD_MAX (63)
instead of _POSIX_CHILD_MAX (3).


<P>
Several minor path bugs have been fixed.  Including the one that
caused "mkdir a/" to fail.


<P>
The include file sys/sysmacros.h has been added.  Added missing protos
for wcslen and wcscmp to wchar.h.


<P>
__P is now defined in include/sys/cdefs.h.  To support that last change,
the top-level Makefile.in now sets CC_FOR_TARGET and CXX_FOR_TARGET
differently.


<P>
Cygwin now exports the following newlib bessel functions: j1, jn, y1,
yn.


<P>
Several tty ioctl options have been added: TCGETA, TCSETA, TCSETAW, and
TCSETAF.


<P>
Several functions cope with NULL pointer references more gracefully.


<P>
Problems with execution of relative paths via #! should be fixed.




<H2><A NAME="SEC114" HREF="faq.html#TOC114">Release Beta 20 (Oct 30 1998)</A></H2>

<P>
This is a significant update to the Beta 19 release.  In addition to an
EGCS-based compiler and updated tools, this release includes a new
version of the Cygwin library that contains many improvements and
bugfixes over the last one.




<H3><A NAME="SEC115" HREF="faq.html#TOC115">The project has a new name!</A></H3>

<P>
Starting with this release, we are retiring the "GNU-Win32" name for the
releases.  We have also dropped the "32" from Cygwin32.  This means that
you should now refer to the tools as "the Cygwin toolset", the library
as "the Cygwin library" or "the Cygwin DLL", and the library's interface
as "the Cygwin API".


<P>
Because of this name change, we have changed any aspects of the library
that involved the name "Cygwin32".  For example, the CYGWIN32
environment variable is now the CYGWIN environment variable.  API
functions starting with cygwin32_ are still available under that form
for backwards-compatibility as well as under the new cygwin_-prefixed
names.  The same goes for the change of preprocessor define from
__CYGWIN32__ to __CYGWIN__.  We will remove the old names in a future
release so please take the minute or two that it will take to remove
those "32"s.  Thanks and I apologize for the hassle this may cause
people.  We would have changed the name to "Bob" but that name's already
taken by Microsoft...  :-)


<P>
Why change it?  For one thing, not all of the software included in the
distributions is GNU software, including the Cygwin library itself.  So
calling the project "GNU-Win32" has always been a bit of a misnomer.  In
addition, we think that calling the tools the "Cygwin tools" that use
the "Cygwin library" will be less confusing to people.


<P>
Also notice that we are now on the spiffy new sourceware.cygnus.com
web/ftp site.  The old address will work for some unknown period of
time (hopefully at least until we get all of the mirrors adjusted).




<H3><A NAME="SEC116" HREF="faq.html#TOC116">Changes in specific tools:</A></H3>

<P>
The latest public EGCS release is now the basis for the compiler used
in Cygwin distributions.  As a result, EGCS 1.1 is the compiler in this
release, with a few additional x86/Cygwin-related patches.


<P>
Those of you who are more interested in native Windows development than
in porting Unix programs will be glad to know that a new gcc flag
"-mno-cygwin" will link in the latest Mingw32 libs and produce an
executable that does not use Cygwin.


<P>
All of the other development tools have been updated to their latest
versions.  The linker (ld) includes many important bug fixes.  It is now
possible to safely strip a DLL with a .reloc section.  The windres
resource compiler is significantly improved.


<P>
Beta 20 also includes upgrades to a number of packages: ash-0.3.2-4,
bash 2.02.1, grep-2.2, ncurses 4.2, and less 332.  We have added bzip2
0.9.0 to the distribution.  And you'll now find that the df utility
has joined its other friends from the fileutils package.


<P>
The sh executable is still ash from the Debian Linux distribution but no
longer has the problematic quoting bug that was present in the Beta 19
release.  Control-Cs in the bash shell no longer kill background tasks.


<P>
Tcl/tk are upgraded to version 8.1a2 (with additional patches).
Compatible versions of tix and itcl are included.  These all include
Cygwin-compatible configury files so you can do a Unix-style build of
the Win32 ports of tcl/tk.  expect has been upgraded to 5.26 with some
additional Cygwin patches.


<P>
In response to customer requests and feedback, Cygnus has developed a
better graphical front end to GDB than GDBtk or WinGDB.  This tcl-based
GUI is shipping today to customers of the GNUPro Toolkit.  The
instrumentation changes to GDB and the tcl interpreter that was built
into GDB are part of the GPL'd source base.  But the tcl scripts are not
being made available to the net at this time.  For this reason, you will
only find a command-line version of gdb in this Cygwin release.


<P>
DJ Delorie has written a new "cygcheck" program that will print out
useful information about how your Cygwin environment is set up, what
DLLs a named executable is loading from where, etc.  We hope this will
make it easier to help diagnose common setup problems.


<P>
The ps utility has been upgraded.  It now has several options including
shorter and longer output formats.




<H3><A NAME="SEC117" HREF="faq.html#TOC117">Changes in the Cygwin API (cygwin.dll):</A></H3>

<P>
This version of Cygwin is backwards-compatible with the beta 19 release.
You can use the new "cygwin1.dll" with your old B19-compiled executables
if you move the old "cygwinb19.dll" out of the way and install a copy
of "cygwin1.dll" as "cygwinb19.dll".


<P>
Quite a lot of the Cygwin internals have been rewritten or modified to
address various issues.  If you have a question about specific changes,
the winsup/ChangeLog file in the development tools sources lists all
changes made to the DLL over the last three years.  Following are a few
highlights:


<P>
We are now using a new versioning scheme for Cygwin.  There is now a
separate version number for the DLL, the API, the shared memory region
interfaces, and the registry interface.  This will hopefully make it
easier for multiple Cygwin toolsets to coexist in one user environment.


<P>
Windows 98 is now supported (it is like Windows 95 from Cygwin's
perspective).  We still recommend upgrading to Windows NT.


<P>
While there is still a lot left to do in improving Cygwin's runtime
performance, we have put some effort into this prior to the B20 release.
Hopefully you will find that the latest version of Cygwin is faster than
ever.  In addition, we have plugged several nasty handle leaks
associated with opening/closing files and with using ttys.


<P>
The lseek call now uses WriteFile to fill gaps with zeros whenever a
write is done past an EOF, rather than leaving "undefined" data as Win32
specifies.


<P>
Significant work has been done to improve the Cygwin header files.


<P>
The Cygwin Support for Unix-style serial I/O is much improved.


<P>
Path handling has had another round of fixes/rewrites.  We no longer use
NT Extended Attributes by default for storing Unix permissions/execute
status because the file NT creates on FAT partitions is not scalable to
thousands of files (everything slows to a crawl).


<P>
Signal handling has also gotten a fair amount of attention.
Unfortunately, there are still some problems combining itimers and
Windows 9x.


<P>
The number of ttys has been upped from 16 to 128.


<P>
New API calls included in the DLL: sethostent, endhostent.


<P>
As mentioned earlier, all cygwin32_-prefixed functions are now exported
with a cygwin_ prefix instead.  Please adjust your code to call the
newly named functions.


<P>
reads of `slow' devices are now correctly interrupted by signals, i.e.
a read will receive an EINTR.




<H2><A NAME="SEC118" HREF="faq.html#TOC118">Release Beta 19 (Feb 26 1998)</A></H2>

<P>
This is a major release.  It includes a much-updated version of the
Cygwin32 library.  Because the Cygwin API has changed in incompatible
ways, the dll has been renamed cygwinb19.dll to avoid invalidating
previously built executables.


<P>
Note that a B19-compiled application exec()ing a B18-compiled
application will treat the B18-compiled executable as an ordinary
Win32 executable.  This means that open file descriptors and some other
internals will not be inheritted on exec() calls.  The reason for this
is that different shared memory areas are used by the different versions
of the cygwin library.  This may or may not be of importance to you
depending on what you're doing.


<P>
The Beta 19 release of the Cygwin32 library continues to be licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL).


<P>
The PE format definition used by the compiler tools now matches
Microsoft's more closely.  This should allow better interoperability
with other vendors' development tools although more work probably
remains to be done in this area.  This change invalidates all previously
built object (.o) and static library (.a) files so be sure to
delete/rebuild old .o and .a files you are using!


<P>
Finally, old symlinks are invalidated by this release.  The "system"
attribute is now used to mark symlinks which significantly speeds
up fstat and other file related calls.  Either recreate old ones or
set their "system" attribute flag so they will be recognized properly.


<P>
The new installer takes care of all environment variable settings
automatically by installing a shortcut in program files that pulls
up a bash prompt with all the correct environment variables set.
As a result, the setup process should be much cleaner than in the last
release.


<P>
For those of you who end up moving the tools around, the batch file
that sets up the default environment is called cygnus.bat and is
installed in the root of the install directory.  Because the tools have
been compiled to install in /cygnus/b19, when installed in this
location, the tools should "just work" if the bin directory is in your
path (no special environment variables are needed).  The only exception
is MAKE_MODE which needs to be set if you want to get ordinary Unix-like
make behavior -- see the make notes below for more information.




<H3><A NAME="SEC119" HREF="faq.html#TOC119">Changes in specific tools:</A></H3>

<P>
Ian Lance Taylor has written a resource compiler called "windres".
It can be used to compile windows resources from a textual rc file
into a COFF file.  The sources are in the binutils subdirectory of
the sources.


<P>
We have upgraded many of the utilities.  Beta 19 includes bash 2.01.1,
fileutils 3.16, gawk 3.0.3, patch 2.5, shellutils 1.16, tar 1.12,
textutils 1.22, and texinfo 3.11.  Bash under Cygwin32 now includes
working job control among other improvements.


<P>
The sh executable is now ash 0.2 from the Debian Linux distribution.
Using this more minimal shell as /bin/sh.exe speeds up configures
significantly.


<P>
Bison 1.25 has been added.


<P>
Tcl/tk are upgraded to version 8.0.  Compatible versions of tix and
itcl have been added.  These all include Cygwin32-compatible configury
files so you can do a Unix-style build of the Win32 ports of tcl/tk.


<P>
Expect 5.21.3 is included and basically works.


<P>
The binaries have been compiled with i686 optimizations turned on
which may result in a speed increase on Pentium-based systems
although the tools should work on i386 and later chips.


<P>
The linker (ld) has been enhanced -- it will now add the idata3
terminator automatically when linking dlls.


<P>
kill now supports signal names in arguments.  ps now shows process
start time information.


<P>
Although the default install of the tools should hide this detail, the
make utility now defaults to a Win32 mode which uses cmd.exe/command.com
as the subshell.  This mode allows the use of backslashes in filenames.
To build Unix programs, you need to set the MAKE_MODE environment
variable to "UNIX".  This way you will get the old behavior of using
sh.exe as the subshell.




<H3><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="faq.html#TOC120">Changes in the Cygwin32 API (cygwin.dll):</A></H3>

<P>
The interface is now better defined.  It contains libc, libm, and
Unix compatability calls.  It no longer contains exports for libgcc.a.
This should result in a more stable interface.  See the calls.texinfo
document for interface documentation.


<P>
There is now only one environment variable called CYGWIN32 that controls
the overall behavior of the dll:


<P>
        set CYGWIN32=[no]title [no]strip_title [no]binmode [no]glob
                strace=mask:cache,file [no]tty


<P>
So if you "set CYGWIN32=title tty", then you would get tty support
(see below) and have the current running process listed in the title
bar.


<P>
B19 adds support for:


<P>
* tty and pseudo-tty devices.  For now, ttys default to off because
taking over the console causes problems with using non-Cygwin console
programs in a Cygwin console.  To turn it on, set the environment
variable CYGWIN32 to include "tty".
* Hard links (requires NT on an NTFS filesystem).  When not possible (on
non-NTFS filesystems), link() will make a copy of the file in question
as it has done in previous releases.
* The SIGWINCH signal.  If tty handling is enabled then the process will
receive a SIGWINCH signal when the screen size changes.
* Additional terminal escape sequences recognized: scroll region setting via
&#60;ESC&#62;[n1;n2r and setting the console title using xterm escape sequence:
&#60;ESC&#62;]2;new title^G .


<P>
The following calls have been added:


<P>
* ptsname, grantpt, unlockpt
* login, logout, ttyslot, ctermid
* cfgetispeed, cfgetospeed, cfsetispeed, cfsetospeed
* setitimer, getitimer, ftime, tzset
* wait3, wait4, pause, sigpause
* getpgid, killpg, setegid (stub)
* strlwr, strupr
* sexecve, sexecl, sexecle, sexeclp, sexeclpe, sexecv, sexecp, sexecvpe
* rcmd, rresvport, rexec
* strsignal, strtosigno
* dlopen, dlsym, dlclose, dlerror
* inet_netof, inet_makeaddr
* socketpair
* fpathconf, realpath, chroot (stub)
* initgroups (stub), getgroups
* random, srandom


<P>
The following calls have been removed:


<P>
* ScreenCols, ScreenGetCursor, ScreenRows, ScreenSetCursor
* getkey, kbhit
* crypt (stub)
* all libgcc.a exports


<P>
The Winsock dll (wsock32.dll) is no longer implicitly linked into
the Cygwin32 dll.  Instead, it is explicitly loaded with LoadLibrary
the first time a process calls a Cygwin32 networking function.  This
speeds up most processes significantly (configures by about 20%).


<P>
The signal-related code has been rewritten from scratch.  Ditto for
most of the path handling code.


<P>
The globbing and getopt code has been replaced with BSD-derived
code.  The regexp code has been replaced with Henry Spencer's PD
implementation.


<P>
Doug Lea's malloc is now being used as the default malloc exported by
cygwin.  This malloc balances speed and compactness very nicely but is
more unforgiving when attempts are made to free already freed memory,
i.e., a segmentation violation will occur.


<P>
The bsearch call has been rewritten.


<P>
Alt Gr-key behavior has been changed in this release.  The left alt-key
still produces ESC-key sequence.  The right alt (Alt Gr)-key now
produces characters according to national keyboard layouts.


<P>
Processes no longer write their name in the title bar unless you include
"title" in the CYGWIN32 environment variable (see above).


<P>
Multiple cygwin.dlls no longer use the same memory space unless they are
identical (built at the same time).  This allows multiple dlls with
incompatible shared memory usage to be run simultaneously.  It also
facilitates debugging a buggy cygwin.dll.  By keeping only a single copy
of the latest cygwin.dll on your system, you can be assured of having
all cygwin processes exist in the same shared memory space.


<P>
The slash mount no longer defaults to C:.  It now defaults to the
system drive letter (where the OS is installed).


<P>
The standard dl* dynamic library loader functions are now available.
Cygwin32 B19 now correctly copies data after a fork and automatically
reloads any DLLs loaded in the parent process.  In addition, dlls will
now be correctly initialized when loaded and global constructors will
be called.  Global destructors will be called when the DLL is detached.
Handles gotten from dlopen or dlsym in the parent will be accessible in a
forked child.  The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is used in the dlopen
search.


<P>
Include the file &#60;cygwin32/cygwin_dll.h&#62; in a cygwin32 created .dll and
use the line DECLARE_CYGWIN_DLL(dll-entry-point) to produce .dlls that
can be used with these functions.




<H2><A NAME="SEC121" HREF="faq.html#TOC121">Release Beta 18 (May 6 1997)</A></H2>

<P>
This is a major release.  The new cygwin.dll is still
backwards-compatible with previously linked applications but
contains significant changes.


<P>
We have completely changed the installation process to make
use of an InstallShield5-based installer.  This should reduce the
number of installation problems people have experienced in the
past.  However, it is still necessary to set environment variables
by hand, as explained in the README.txt accompanying the distribution.
(Future gnu-win32 installers may include the capability to do this
automatically).




<H3><A NAME="SEC122" HREF="faq.html#TOC122">Changes in specific tools:</A></H3>

<P>
GCC compilation times have been improved by 20-30% by using spawn()
instead of fork().


<P>
GCC accepts both Win32 and POSIX paths/path lists in its
environment variables (COMPILER_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH,
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH)


<P>
GDB comes with a tcl/tk-based GUI (gdbtk).  You can still invoke the
command line gdb by invoking it with "gdb -nw".


<P>
Bash verifies that /tmp exists and is a directory upon startup.
It complains if this isn't the case.


<P>
Running gcc or ld with "-s" used to create invalid executables.
The bug in bfd that was responsible for this has been fixed.


<P>
The conflict between String.h and string.h (and other such pairs
of header files) where you include one and get the other has been
fixed.


<P>
The top level install-sh script tries to install foo.exe if asked
to install foo when foo's not present.  This fixes many installs
of Unix software.


<P>
Dlltool has preliminary support for the IMPORT declaration in .def files
when invoked with -I.  Feel free to experiment with it but once this
functionality is tested more extensively this flag may go away.


<P>
Time is upgraded to version 1.7.


<P>
Make is upgraded to version 3.75.


<P>
Make accepts both Win32 and POSIX path lists in the VPATH variable.




<H3><A NAME="SEC123" HREF="faq.html#TOC123">Changes in the Cygwin32 API (cygwin.dll):</A></H3>

<P>
The following is now supported:


<P>
* UNC paths
* Reverse index escapes in console code
* Blocking select()s on a combination of sockets/handles
* Directory symlinks.
* Reparenting of child processes.


<P>
The following calls have been added:


<P>
* mmap(), mprotect(), msync(), munmap().  fork() changed to support these.
* fsync(), statfs(), fstatfs().
* getprotobynumber() and getservbyport().
* get_osfhandle(), cwait().
* spawnl(), spawnle(), spawnlp(), spawnlpe(), spawnv(), spawnve(),
spawnvp(), spawnvpe().
* nice().
* sigpending(), sigsuspend()
* Under NT only, chown(), getgrgid(), getgrnam(), endgrent(), getgrent(),
setpwend(), getpwent(), endpwent().  Win95 still has these as stubs.


<P>
Significantly better signals / exception handling support added.
The kill signal works much better now (control-C works in bash).


<P>
Shell scripts now run the shell specified after the #! instead of
always defaulting to /bin/sh.


<P>
Floating point registers are now properly initialized in the crt0.o.


<P>
Opening non-disk files such as com ports no longer check to see
if they are symlinks or executables.


<P>
The console title now is set to the name of the running process.


<P>
Winsock is now initialized upon app startup.


<P>
Moved reent_data from private address space to cygwin.dll.


<P>
The system() call now invokes spawnvp() instead of fork()/exec().


<P>
Support for NT extended attributes has been added but is disabled
for now because it slowed things down too much.  We want to use them to
remember info about symlink and executable status of files.


<P>
Under NT only, utilities mkpasswd and mkgroup can generate a valid
/etc/passwd and /etc/group.


<P>
Earlier releases stored mount points in the registry under
"Cygnus Support".  This changed to "Cygnus Solutions" starting
with beta 18.  Either use a registry editor (regedit under NT)
to rename the old entry or just redo your mount points and the
cygwin.dll will automatically create the new one for you.


<P>
Mount points can now be up to MAX_PATH in length instead of 30
characters.




<H2><A NAME="SEC124" HREF="faq.html#TOC124">Release Beta 17.1 (Dec 10 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
A patch has been applied to make Win 95 configure work again.


<P>
ld has been changed to make "a.exe" be the default executable name.




<H2><A NAME="SEC125" HREF="faq.html#TOC125">Release Beta 17 (Dec 7 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
It is now possible to rebuild the tools natively under x86 NT when
the full Cygnus Developers' Kit (CDK) and the User Tools are both
installed correctly.


<P>
While the cygwin.dll underwent substantial changes, none of them
prevent you from using previously built applications  The new dll
is compatible with beta 16 to the best of our knowledge.  Beta 14-built
programs will continue to fail with the beta 17 dll -- you will have to
relink them before they will work.


<P>
The winsup files that make up the Cygwin32 API are now under the
GNU General Public License.  See the accompanying press release
for more information.




<H3><A NAME="SEC126" HREF="faq.html#TOC126">Changes in specific tools:</A></H3>

<P>
Gcc now links by default against -lkernel32 and also against
-luser32 -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 when mwindows is set.  Another major
change is that when creating an executable, gcc will now create
foo.exe when given a -o argument of foo.


<P>
Dlltool has patches to make it better handle the --subsystem argument
that allows choosing console vs. GUI among other options.
ld has been changed to have a much larger stack reserve size.  This
is necessary when rebuilding the toolchain natively under NT.


<P>
The C++ headers can now be found given a correctly set GCC_EXEC_PREFIX
environment variable.


<P>
New versions of fileutils and make are included.  Findutils has been
added.




<H3><A NAME="SEC127" HREF="faq.html#TOC127">Changes in the Cygwin32 API (cygwin.dll):</A></H3>

<P>
Scott Christley's headers and def files for the standard Win32 dlls
have been integrated.  Anything present only in the previous Cygnus headers
has been added in the appropriate places.  There are placeholder files
with the standard Win32 header names that pull in our headers so
programs that try to include specific headers should continue to work.
Having more complete headers should make Win32 native programming
easier.


<P>
Select has been rewritten from scratch.  The new one can deal with
all sockets, handles and sockets always ready, all handles.  Handles
and sockets with timeout not implemented yet.  Select now does
blocking and doesn't spin cpu.


<P>
File handling has been largely rewritten:
The fhandler array has been moved into local memory instead of shared
memory.  This makes a number of things behave better.  Lots of changes
to support this.  There is now fairly complete ansi/vt100 console support.
Some new file locking support has been added.  Arrow keys are now
supported.


<P>
Process handling much improved.


<P>
Significant serious bugs in fork() fixed.


<P>
The system() call now works.


<P>
unlink() now chmods read-only files to writable before attempting to
delete a file.  This fixes the outstanding problem where rm can't
delete read-only files saying "out of queue slots" repeatedly.


<P>
Text mode read has been rewritten.


<P>
New syslog code allows logging to event log under NT, file under Win 95.


<P>
Symlinks are enabled.


<P>
readv() and writev() have been written and exported.


<P>
For MS compatibility, we now export functions in the dll as _funcname
in addition to funcname.  I would suggest not making use of this fact
unless you are building code that already accesses C library calls
in this way.


<P>
Almost all of the source code is now in C++ files.




<H2><A NAME="SEC128" HREF="faq.html#TOC128">Release Beta 16 (Aug 30 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
Path handling has been completely rewritten.  To refer to drive Q: in
bash, you can now refer to //q/.  Alternatively, type "mount Q: /q" to
have drive Q: show up as /q.


<P>
We now pass the Plum Hall positive C conformance tests on the
i386 under Windows 95 and NT 4.0b2.


<P>
Fork was previously not accessible inside the dll.  This is no
longer the case which should allow us to add working system and popen
calls.


<P>
getdomainname works (it used to just return "cygnus.com") by getting
information from registry.


<P>
Fixed readdir bug that set errno improperly.  This fixed the problem
with diff not working across directories.


<P>
Better error checking in signal functions.  Initialize winsock in
cygwin32_socket with checkinit call (fixes bug that required calling any
function that did this first).


<P>
New functions: sigaddset, sigismember, sigfillset, sigemptyset.


<P>
Removed extra underscores present in sysdef files.


<P>
There is a now a major and a minor version number associated with
the cygwin.dll.  The major number changes only when incompatible changes
are made, the minor number changes when significant changes are made
to the dll that don't require relinking of old apps.


<P>
Changed value of HZ in include/sys/param.h to correct value of 1000.
(Fixes bug people reported about "time sleep 5" returning 50).


<P>
Assorted exception handling fixes for both i386 and ppc processors.


<P>
Assorted time-related fixes required for Cygnus Kerberos work.
New time functions: gmtime, corelocaltime


<P>
Assorted spawn and fork fixes.


<P>
Pseudo-Unix process handling added -- new ps and kill commands added


<P>
Control-Z's are now handled as a valid EOF token in files opened as
text.
lseek now always operates in binary mode.


<P>
Select revamped.


<P>
Various other changes.  For more detailed information, consult the file
in the source code winsup/ChangeLog.


<P>
Preprocessor define scheme changed.  Apps should now use _WIN32
instead of __WIN32__ to check for access to Win32 API and __CYGWIN32__
to check for presence of the Cygwin32 environment.


<P>
We are no longer including GNU findutils, GNU dbm, GNU bison,
GNU less, ncurses, ftp, finger, rcl, cvtres, or V.  This may or may not
change in the future.


<P>
You must relink old apps you built with prior releases with the new
cygwin.dll.




<H2><A NAME="SEC129" HREF="faq.html#TOC129">Release Beta 14 (April 10 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
Some bugs have been fixed.  GDBM and m4 are in the release.  GCC now
uses the standard install directories for cc1 etc.


<P>
A port of V to gnu-win32 is included.  You can now write graphics
applications which will run on Unix or Windows unchanged.  Some parts of
V work on the PPC too.


<P>
If you call any programs from the standard DOS shell, then the DLL will
expand all the wildcards (glob) found in the arguments on the command
line.  So ls *.exe will do what you think it should, even if you're not
in bash.


<P>
ncurses and less are included. The DLL's emulation of a vt100 isn't complete,
so ncurses doesn't do all that it should. Hence less is more or less
useless.  This can be fixed with a new DLL.  (If you want to use
something which uses curses, be sure to set your TERM and HOME
envirionment variables)


<P>
If you leave out main, then the libraries will try and call WinMain in the
usual way.


<P>
^C works much better on Windows 95.  It's still not quite right, but at
least most times it quits what you're doing, and most times doesn't
crash your machine.


<P>
You can start more than one concurrent bash session. 


<P>
Some networking support has been added.  Even though telnet.exe is provided,
I know that it doesn't work, so please don't send me bug reports.


<P>
You will have to relink your applications to go with the new DLL.


<P>
The DLL is released in its own .zip file too, so you don't have to
download a load of other stuff if you dont want to.




<H2><A NAME="SEC130" HREF="faq.html#TOC130">Release Beta 13 (Feb 9 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
Files are opened in binary mode, unless the registry is fiddled with.


<P>
The `cat &#62;foo &#60;&#60;EOF bug is fixed.


<P>
The symlink cookie has changed, so old links wont work any more.


<P>
Two resource tools are provided (untested).


<P>
More windows header files are provided. WxWindows almost compiles.


<P>
You can get to a raw floppy with `/dev/fd0 or `/dev/fd1.


<P>
You can have two filenames with the same name and different case in
the same directory.


<P>
Stat now fills in the st_nlink field for directories, so find works
better.


<P>
This version is much more stable than any previous version, and will
stay running long enough to configure and build itself on my NT box.


<P>
This version is also available in PowerPC versions.  The PowerPC
compiler doesn't do stack probing, so some applications won't work, or
they'll only work on some input data - e.g. the demo "hello world" will
compile, but gcc will crash compiling the dhrystone benchmark.


<P>
There's a new registry variable "fmode=binary" which controls
whether the tools always open files in binary mode (unless overridden
with O_TEXT), or always open files in text mode (unless overridden with
O_BINARY).


<P>
Filesystems can be mounted with the mixed_case flag.  This allows
you to use filenames with the same spelling, but different case in the
same directory.


<P>
I haven't tested or even used some of the packages that I've
provided.  I compiled them, and then fixed the obvious "the file should
have been opened in binary mode" problems.


<P>
I've already had reports of some of it not working correctly on
Windows 95.  I don't have a simple to use Windows 95 configuration, but
when I did try "it worked for me".  This may be another manifestation
of the bug which makes bash hang sometimes under NT.




<H2><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="faq.html#TOC131">Release Beta 12 (Jan 3 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
You can call non- gnu-win32 applications from bash.


<P>
You can mount other directories using the <CODE>mount</CODE> command.


<P>
Minimal ANSI terminal emulation included.


<P>
Packages split into smaller and more logical lumps.


<P>
/d&#60;name&#62; mechanism gone.


<P>
Initial support for the PowerPC added.




<H2><A NAME="SEC132" HREF="faq.html#TOC132">Release Beta 11 (Jan 3 1996)</A></H2>

<P>
Something broke on the way to the ftp site.




<H2><A NAME="SEC133" HREF="faq.html#TOC133">Release Beta 10 (Dec 5 1995)</A></H2>

<P>
You can pass environment variables around in bash.


<P>
Lots more stuff provided precompiled.


<P>
Diffs to standard FSF release provided.


<P>
It self-hosts.


<P>
It supports symbolic links.


<P>
The directory layout has changed to be more unix like.


<P>
The way that you get to non-c drives is new - i:\foo.cc
is now /di/foo.cc


<P>
Nasty bug found and fixed in fork.


<P>
CPP will now search the directories you supply in env names.




<H2><A NAME="SEC134" HREF="faq.html#TOC134">Release Beta 9</A></H2>

<P>
I've put all of libc and libm into a shared library,
This drastically reduces the size of some binaries.
e.g., ls goes from 82,949 bytes to 26,624.
"Hello World" is 2564 bytes long.
This is the first stage in greatly speeding up 
some of the stuff that's going on behind the curtain.


<P>
Different processes communicate using shared memory.


<P>
Some trivial use of the registry is made.


<P>
DLLTOOL is now *much* faster.


<P>
Some small problems have been fixed in the way that DLLs were
layed out.	




<H2><A NAME="SEC135" HREF="faq.html#TOC135">Release Beta 8</A></H2>

<P>
GDB works.


<P>
GCC now emits debug info which can make **huge** executables
Fortunately, strip works too.


<P>
More work has been done to make quoting work.


<P>
Simple termios support added to newlib.


<P>
Much nicer way of describing paths, eg //c/foo is c:\foo.




<H2><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="faq.html#TOC136">Release Beta 7</A></H2>

<P>
Works again on Win 95 (which is why -6 wasn't advertised).


<P>
Permissions are faked better.


<P>
Source of demos available without having to ftp the entire win32
binary tree. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="faq.html#TOC137">Release Beta 6</A></H2>

<P>
Can now generate DLLs, tiny demo included.
tcl, byacc, fileutils, diff, make included.




<H2><A NAME="SEC138" HREF="faq.html#TOC138">Release Beta 5</A></H2>

<P>
Bug preventing anything from running on recent versions
of Win95 fixed.


<P>
vfork and exec oddities fixed.


<P>
Import libraries are now really libraries and not
just .o files.


<P>
Debugging info stripped from images and libraries;
it's just bloat until gdb works.


<P>
I've filled in the four major import libraries.


<P>
The win*.h files are now installed into &#60;foo&#62;/include
rather that &#60;foo&#62;/include/sys, so more things will
compile out of the box.




<H2><A NAME="SEC139" HREF="faq.html#TOC139">Release Beta 4</A></H2>

<P>
PE support is fixed. Programs run on
NT 3.1, NT 3.5, NT 3.51 and Windows 95.


<P>
You can build GUI programs.


<P>
.DEF files for three other DLL's started.


<P>
New GUI demo program. 


<P>
C library distinguishes between text and binary files
consequently the text files generated by the
tools have the familiar ^M at the end of the line
which DOS likes so much.


<P>
Doug Evans of Cygnus has added a load
of fancy support for execve, opendir and 
various other cool things.


<P>
Exception handling is better.




<H2><A NAME="SEC140" HREF="faq.html#TOC140">Release Beta 3</A></H2>

<P>
Was so long ago we don't remember.


<H1><A NAME="SEC141" HREF="faq.html#TOC141">Who's behind the project?</A></H1>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>


<P>
Chris Faylor (cgf@cygnus.com) is behind many of the recent
changes in Cygwin.  Prior to joining Cygnus, he contributed significant
fixes to the process control and environ code, reworked the strace
mechanism, and rewrote the signal-related code from scratch as a Net
contributor.  In addition to continuing to make technical contributions,
Chris is also currently the group's manager.


<P>
Geoffrey Noer (noer@cygnus.com) took over the Cygwin project from its'
initial author Steve Chamberlain in mid-1996.  As maintainer, he
produced Net releases beta 16 through 20; made the development
snapshots; worked with Net contributors to fix bugs; made many various
code improvements himself; wrote a paper on Cygwin for the
1998 Usenix NT Symposium; authored the project WWW pages, FAQ, README;
etc.


<P>
DJ Delorie (dj@cygnus.com) has done important work in profiling Cygwin,
worked on the Dejagnu automated testing framework, merged the dlltool
functionality into ld, wrote a good deal of the Cygwin Users' Guide,
authored the cygcheck utility, and made automated snapshots available
from our project WWW page.


<P>
Steve Chamberlain (sac@transmeta.com) designed and implemented
Cygwin in 1995-1996 while working for Cygnus.  He worked with the Net
to improve the technology, ported/integrated many of the user tools
for the first time to Cygwin, and produced all of the releases up to
beta 14.


<P>
Marco Fuykschot (marco@ddi.nl) and Peter Boncz (boncz@ddi.nl) of
Data Distilleries contributed nearly all of the changes required to
make Cygwin thread-safe.  They also provided the pthreads interface.


<P>
Sergey Okhapkin (sos@prospect.com.ru) has been an invaluable Net
contributor.  He implemented the tty/pty support, has played a
significant role in revamping signal and exception handling, and has
made countless contributions throughout the library.  He also provided
binaries of the development snapshots to the Net after the beta 19
release.


<P>
Mumit Khan (khan@xraylith.wisc.edu) has been most helpful on the EGCS
end of things, providing quite a large number of stabilizing patches to
the compiler tools for the B20 release.


<P>
Corinna Vinschen &#60;corinna@vinschen.de&#62; has contributed several
useful fixes to the path handling code, console support, improved security
handling, and raw device support.


<P>
Philippe Giacinti (giac@dalim.de) contributed the implementation of
dlopen, dlclose, dlsym, dlfork, and dlerror in Cygwin.


<P>
Many other people at Cygnus have made important contributions to Cygwin.
Tobin Brockett wrote the InstallShield-based installer for the beta 19
and 20 releases.  Ian Lance Taylor did a much-needed rework of the path
handling code for beta 18, and has made many assorted fixes throughout
the code.  Jeremy Allison made significant contributions in the area of
file handling and process control, and rewrote select from scratch.
Doug Evans rewrote the path-handling code in beta 16, among other
things.  Kim Knuttila and Michael Meissner put in many long hours
working on the now-defunct PowerPC port.  Jason Molenda and Mark Eichin
have also made important contributions.


<P>
Please note that those of us here at Cygnus that work on Cygwin try to
be as responsive as possible and deal with patches and questions as we
get them, but realistically we don't have time to answer all of the
email that is sent to the main mailing list.  Making Net releases of the
Win32 tools and helping people on the Net out is not our primary job
function, so some email will have to go unanswered.


<P>
Many thanks to everyone using the tools for their many contributions in
the form of advice, bug reports, and code fixes.  Keep them coming!


<H1><A NAME="SEC142" HREF="faq.html#TOC142">What are the copyrights ?</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC143" HREF="faq.html#TOC143">The general idea</A></H2>

<P>
Most of the tools are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL),
although some are public domain, and others have a X11-style
copyright.  To cover the GNU GPL
requirements, the basic rule is if you give out any binaries, you must
also make the source available.  For the full details, be sure to
read the text of the GNU GPL which follows.


<P>
The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the
source code is also covered by the GNU GPL.  By default, all
executables link against this library (and in the process include GPL'd
Cygwin glue code).  This means that unless you modify the tools
so that compiled executables do not make use of the Cygwin library,
your compiled programs will also have to be free software distributed
under the GPL with source code available to all.


<P>
Cygwin is currently available for proprietary use only through a
proprietary-use license.  Please contact sales@cygnus.com for
more information.


<P>
In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Cygnus permits programs whose
sources are distributed under a license that complies with the Open
Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without libcygwin.a
itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.


<P>
This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the cygwin
DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the DLL
you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e., you must provide sources
for the cygwin DLL.


<P>
See http://www.opensource.org/osd.html for the precise Open Source
Definition referenced above.

License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &#60;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&#62;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &#60;name of author&#62;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &#60;signature of Ty Coon&#62;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
