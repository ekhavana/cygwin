The
applications are linked with it and voila - they run on Windows.
</p><p>The aim is to add all the goop necessary to make your apps run on
Windows into the C library.  Then your apps should run on Unix and
Windows with no changes at the source level.
</p><p>The C library is in a DLL, which makes basic applications quite small.
And it allows relatively easy upgrades to the Win32/Unix translation
layer, providing that DLL changes stay backward-compatible.

</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a file and what the file contains is whatever the
program/programmer/user told it to put into it.  In Windows, a file is
also a file and what the file contains depends not only on the
program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode.
</p><p>When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially.  A \n (new line) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return) so that if you `printf("Hello\n") you in fact get
"Hello\r\n".  Upon reading this combination, the \r is removed and the
number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less than was actually read.
This tends to confuse programs dependent on ftell() and fseek().  A
Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even
though it truly isn't the end of file.
</p><p>One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to easily mix Cygwin-ported
Unix programs with generic Windows programs.  As a result, Cygwin opens
files in text mode as is normal under Windows.  In the accompanying
tools, tools that deal with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in Unix
binary mode and tools that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in
text mode.
</p><p>Some people push the notion of globally setting the default processing
mode to binary via mount point options or by setting the CYGWIN
environment variable.  But that creates a different problem.  In
binary mode, the program receives all of the data in the file, including
a \r.  Since the programs will no longer deal with these properly for
you, you would have to remove the \r from the relevant text files,
especially scripts and startup resource files.  This is a porter "cop
out", forcing the user to deal with the \r for the porter.
</p><p>It is rather easy for the porter to fix the source code by supplying the
appropriate file processing mode switches to the open/fopen functions.
Treat all text files as text and treat all binary files as binary.  To be
specific, you can select binary mode by adding <code class="literal">O_BINARY</code> to
the second argument of an <code class="literal">open</code> call, or
<code class="literal">"b"</code> to second argument of an <code class="literal">fopen</code> call.
You can also call <code class="literal">setmode (fd, O_BINARY)</code>.
</p><p>Note that because the open/fopen switches are defined by ANSI, they
exist under most flavors of Unix; open/fopen will just ignore the switch
since they have no meaning to UNIX.

of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do).  Because of this it
can be a little slow.  In most cases, you are better off using the
spawn family of calls if possible.
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><p>Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself.  Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks).  Parent fills in the child's
.data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into
the suspended child's address space.  Parent then starts the child.
Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.  Child starts and
discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump
buffer.  Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on
another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap.  Parent
notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into
child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the
fork call.  Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped
areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.

`globber' over the arguments provided on the command line.  This means
that if you type <code class="literal">LS *.EXE</code> from DOS, it will do what you might
expect.
</p><p>Beware: globbing uses <code class="literal">malloc</code>.  If your application defines
<code class="literal">malloc</code>, that will get used.  This may do horrible things to you.

</p><p>The old method is the only valid one up to but not including version 1.3.0.
If it's enabled (from 1.3.0 on by setting `nowinsymlinks' in the environment
variable CYGWIN) Cygwin generates link files with a magic header.  When you
open a file or directory that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file
or directory listed in the magic header.  Because we don't want to have to
open every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin marks symlinks
with the system attribute.  Files without the system attribute are not
checked.  Because remote samba filesystems do not enable the system
attribute by default, symlinks do not work on network drives unless you
explicitly enable this attribute.
</p><p>The new method which is introduced with Cygwin version 1.3.0 is enabled
by default or if `winsymlinks' is set in the environment variable CYGWIN.
Using this method, Cygwin generates symlinks by creating Windows shortcuts.
Cygwin created shortcuts have a special header (which is in that way never
created by Explorer) and the R/O attribute set.  A DOS path is stored in
the shortcut as usual and the description entry is used to store the POSIX
path.  While the POSIX path is stored as is, the DOS path has perhaps to be
rearranged to result in a valid path.  This may result in a divergence
between the DOS and the POSIX path when symlinks are moved crossing mount
points.  When a user changes the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin
and it will only use the DOS path then.  While Cygwin shortcuts are shown
without the ".lnk" suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin shortcuts are shown
with the suffix.  However, both are treated as symlinks.
</p><p>Both, the old and the new symlinks can live peacefully together since Cygwin
treats both as symlinks regardless of the setting of `(no)winsymlinks' in
the environment variable CYGWIN.

in the cygwin dll that would allow users to gain privileges or to access
objects to which they have no rights under Windows. However there is no

processes share some variables and are thus easier targets of denial of
service type of attacks.

</p><p>The network support in Cygwin is supposed to provide the Unix API, not
the Winsock API.
</p><p>There are differences between the semantics of functions with the same
name under the API.
</p><p>E.g., the select system call on Unix can wait on a standard file handles
and handles to sockets.  The select call in Winsock can only wait on
sockets.  Because of this, cygwin.dll does a lot of nasty stuff behind
the scenes, trying to persuade various Winsock/win32 functions to do what
a Unix select would do.
</p><p>If you are porting an application which already uses Winsock, then
using the net support in Cygwin is wrong.
</p><p>But you can still use native Winsock, and use Cygwin.  The functions
which cygwin.dll exports are called 'cygwin_&lt;name&gt;'.  There
are a load of defines which map the standard Unix names to the names
exported by the DLL-- check out include/netdb.h:
</p><pre class="screen">
..etc..
void		cygwin_setprotoent (int);
void		cygwin_setservent (int);
void		cygwin_setrpcent (int);
..etc..
#ifndef __INSIDE_CYGWIN_NET__
#define endprotoent cygwin_endprotoent 
#define endservent cygwin_endservent 
#define endrpcent  cygwin_endrpcent  
..etc..
</pre><p>The idea is that you'll get the Unix-&gt;Cygwin mapping if you include
the standard Unix header files.  If you use this, you won't need to
link with libwinsock.a - all the net stuff is inside the DLL.
</p><p>The mywinsock.h file is a standard winsock.h which has been hacked to
remove the bits which conflict with the standard Unix API, or are
defined in other headers.  E.g., in mywinsock.h, the definition of
struct hostent is removed.  This is because on a Unix box, it lives in
netdb.  It isn't a good idea to use it in your applications.
</p><p>As of the b19 release, this information may be slightly out of date.

and #include "windows.h" (or "winsock2.h" at the top of your source file(s).  You may
find it easier to add "-D__USE_W32_WINSOCK" to the CFLAGS settings in your makefile,
if you are using one, as this will then apply to all your source files.  It is also
worth using "#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN" before you include the windows header file,
as this will prevent it from pulling in lots of header files for all sorts of unrelated
windows APIs when all you want is the Winsock definitions; again, this could be set
for the entire project in your CFLAGS.
</p><p>
You'll also need to add -lwsock32 to the compiler's command line (or the makefile's
list of link libs) so that you link against libwsock32.a.

shared library.  First of all, since October 1998 every Cygwin DLL has
been named <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> and has a 1 in the release name.
Additionally, there are DLL major and minor numbers that correspond to
the name of the release, and a release number. In other words,
cygwin-1.5.10-2 is <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code>, major version 5, minor version
10, release 2.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> major version number gets incremented only when a
change is made that makes existing software incompatible. For example,
the first major version 5 release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added 64-bit file I/O
operations, which required many libraries to be recompiled and relinked.
The minor version changes every time we make a new backward compatible
Cygwin release available.  There is also a <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> release
version number.  The release number is only incremented if we update an
existing release in a way that does not effect the DLL (like a missing
header file).
</p><p>There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.  The major number
tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to the API.
An executable linked with an earlier major number will not be compatible
with the latest DLL.  The minor number tracks significant API additions
or changes that will not break older executables but may be required by
newly compiled ones.
</p><p>Then there is a shared memory region compatibility version number.  It is
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared memory
region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.  Finally there
is a mount point registry version number which keeps track
of non-backwards-compatible changes to the registry mount table layout.
This has been <code class="literal">mounts v2</code> for a long time. For more exciting Cygwin
version number details, check out the <code class="literal">/usr/include/cygwin/version.h</code>
file.
