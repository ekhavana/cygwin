The
applications are linked with it and voila - they run on Windows.
</p><p>The aim is to add all the goop necessary to make your apps run on
Windows into the C library.  Then your apps should (ideally) run on POSIX
systems (Unix/Linux) and Windows with no changes at the source level.
</p><p>The C library is in a DLL, which makes basic applications quite small.
And it allows relatively easy upgrades to the Win32/POSIX translation
layer, providing that DLL changes stay backward-compatible.

debugging problems in a buggy snapshot, avoid these and wait for a real
release.  The snapshots are available from

</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a name="faq.api.cr-lf"></a><a name="idp6582752"></a><p><b>3.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>How is the DOS/Unix CR/LF thing handled?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Let's start with some background.
</p><p>On POSIX systems, a file is a file and what the file contains is
whatever the program/programmer/user told it to put into it.  In Windows,
a file is also a file and what the file contains depends not only on the
program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode.
</p><p>When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially.  A \n (new line, NL) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return, CR) so that if you `printf("Hello\n") you in fact get
"Hello\r\n".  Upon reading this combination, the \r is removed and the
number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less than was actually read.
This tends to confuse programs dependent on ftell() and fseek().  A
Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even
though it truly isn't the end of file.
</p><p>One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to mix Cygwin-ported
POSIX programs with generic Windows programs.  As a result, Cygwin allows
to open files in text mode.  In the accompanying tools, tools that deal
with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in POSIX binary mode and many (but
not all) tools that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in text mode.
There are also some text tools which operate in a mixed mode.  They read
files always in text mode, but write files in binary mode, or they write
in the mode (text or binary) which is specified by the underlying mount
point.  For a description of mount points, see the Cygwin User's Guide.
</p><p>Actually there's no really good reason to do text mode processing
since it only slows down reading and writing files.  Additionally many
Windows applications can deal with POSIX \n line endings just fine
(unfortunate exception: Notepad).  So we suggest to use binary mode
as much as possible and only convert files from or to DOS text mode
using tools specifically created to do that job, for instance, d2u and
u2d from the cygutils package.
</p><p>It is rather easy for the porter of a Unix package to fix the source
code by supplying the appropriate file processing mode switches to the
open/fopen functions.  Treat all text files as text and treat all binary
files as binary.  To be specific, you can select binary mode by adding
<code class="literal">O_BINARY</code> to the second argument of an
<code class="literal">open</code> call, or <code class="literal">"b"</code> to second argument
of an <code class="literal">fopen</code> call.  You can also call
<code class="literal">setmode (fd, O_BINARY)</code>.  To select text mode add
<code class="literal">O_TEXT</code> to the second argument of an <code class="literal">open</code>
call, or <code class="literal">"t"</code> to second argument of an
<code class="literal">fopen</code> call, or just call
<code class="literal">setmode (fd, O_TEXT)</code>.
</p><p>You can also avoid to change the source code at all by linking
an additional object file to your executable.  Cygwin provides various
object files in the <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code> directory which,
when linked to an executable, changes the default open modes of any
file opened within the executed process itself.  The files are
</p><pre class="screen">
  binmode.o      - Open all files in binary mode.
  textmode.o     - Open all files in text mode.
  textreadmode.o - Open all files opened for reading in text mode.
  automode.o     - Open all files opened for reading in text mode,
                   all files opened for writing in binary mode.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
  Linking against these object files does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> change
  the open mode of files propagated to a process by its parent process,
  for instance, if the process is part of a shell pipe expression.
</div><p>
</p><p>Note that of the above flags only the "b" fopen flags are defined by
ANSI.  They exist under most flavors of Unix.  However, using O_BINARY,
O_TEXT, or the "t" flag is non-portable.

of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do).  Because of this it
can be a little slow.  In most cases, you are better off using the
spawn family of calls if possible.
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><p>Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself.  Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks).  Parent fills in the child's
.data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address space into
the suspended child's address space.  Parent then starts the child.
Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.  Child starts and
discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the saved jump
buffer.  Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then blocks on
another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack and heap.  Parent
notices child is in safe area, copies stack and heap from itself into
child, releases the mutex the child is waiting on and returns from the
fork call.  Child wakes from blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped
areas passed to it via shared area and then returns from fork itself.

`globber' over the arguments provided on the command line.  This means
that if you type <code class="literal">LS *.EXE</code> from DOS, it will do what you might
expect.
</p><p>Beware: globbing uses <code class="literal">malloc</code>.  If your application defines
<code class="literal">malloc</code>, that will get used.  This may do horrible things to you.

</p><p>The default method generates link files with a magic header.  When you
open a file or directory that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file
or directory listed in the magic header.  Because we don't want to have to
open every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin marks symlinks
with the system attribute.  Files without the system attribute are not
checked.  Because remote samba filesystems do not enable the system
attribute by default, symlinks do not work on network drives unless you
explicitly enable this attribute or use the second method to create symlinks.
</p><p>The second method is enabled if `winsymlinks' is set in the environment
variable CYGWIN.
Using this method, Cygwin generates symlinks by creating Windows shortcuts.
Cygwin created shortcuts have a special header (which is in that way never
created by Explorer) and the R/O attribute set.  A DOS path is stored in
the shortcut as usual and the description entry is used to store the POSIX
path.  While the POSIX path is stored as is, the DOS path has perhaps to be
rearranged to result in a valid path.  This may result in a divergence
between the DOS and the POSIX path when symlinks are moved crossing mount
points.  When a user changes the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin
and it will only use the DOS path then.  While Cygwin shortcuts are shown
without the ".lnk" suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin shortcuts are shown
with the suffix.  However, both are treated as symlinks.
</p><p>Both, types of symlinks can live peacefully together since Cygwin
treats both as symlinks regardless of the setting of `(no)winsymlinks' in
the environment variable CYGWIN.

certain filesystems (FAT, FAT32), the library has to fill out some information
not provided by these filesystems.
</p><p>It guesses that files ending in .exe and .bat are executable, as are
ones which have a "#!" as their first characters.  This guessing doesn't
take place on filesystems providing real permission information (NTFS, NFS),
unless you switch the permission handling off using the mount flag "noacl"
on these filesystems.

name under the API.

and handles to sockets.  The select call in Winsock can only wait on
sockets.  Because of this, the Cygwin dll does a lot of nasty stuff behind
the scenes, trying to persuade various Winsock/Win32 functions to do what
a Unix select would do.
</p><p>If you are porting an application which already uses Winsock, then
porting the application to Cygwin means to port the application to using
the POSIX net functions.  You should never mix Cygwin net functions with
direct calls to Winsock functions.  If you use Cygwin, use the POSIX API.

shared library.  First of all, since October 1998 every Cygwin DLL has
been named <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> and has a 1 in the release name.
Additionally, there are DLL major and minor numbers that correspond to
the name of the release, and a release number. In other words,
cygwin-1.7.1-2 is <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code>, major version 7, minor
version 1, release 2.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> major version number gets incremented
only when a change is made that makes existing software incompatible. For
example, the first major version 5 release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added 64-bit
file I/O operations, which required many libraries to be recompiled and
relinked.  The minor version changes every time we make a new backward
compatible Cygwin release available.  There is also a
<code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> release version number.  The release number
is only incremented if we update an existing release in a way that does not
effect the DLL (like a missing header file).
</p><p>There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.  The major number
tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to the API.
An executable linked with an earlier major number will not be compatible
with the latest DLL.  The minor number tracks significant API additions
or changes that will not break older executables but may be required by
newly compiled ones.
</p><p>Then there is a shared memory region compatibility version number.  It is
incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared memory
region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.  For more exciting
Cygwin version number details, check out the
<code class="literal">/usr/include/cygwin/version.h</code> file.
