to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space character.

</p><p>Cygwin shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native Windows
applications.  Windows applications can usually make use of Cygwin
shortcuts but not vice versa.  This is by choice.  The reason is that
Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which would
get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts them as
symlinks.
</p><p>Changing a Cygwin shortcut in Windows Explorer usually changes a Cygwin
shortcut into a Windows native shortcut.  Afterwards, Cygwin will not
recognize it as symlink anymore.

you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.
</p><p>If the path argument to find, including current directory (default), is
itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it unless you
specify the <tt class="literal">-follow</tt> option.  This behavior is different than most
other UNIX implementations, but is not likely to change.
</p><p>If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to be
missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem with one
of find's optimisations.  The absence of <tt class="literal">.</tt> and <tt class="literal">..</tt>

volunteer who is rarely the same person as the official developer of the

</p><p>Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</p><p>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</pre><p>
and
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /
</pre><p>
for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.
</p><p><span class="bold"><b>Warning:</b></span> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.
</p><p>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</pre><p>
Then <tt class="literal">/cygdrive/c/Windows</tt> becomes <tt class="literal">/c/Windows</tt> which is a
little less typing.
</p><p>Note that you only need to mount drives once.  The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely.
You can only get rid of them with umount, or the registry editor.
</p><p>The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode
("binmode") where text and binary files are treated equivalently.  This
should only be necessary for badly ported Unix programs where binary
flags are missing from open calls.  It is also the setting for /,
/usr/bin and /usr/lib in a default Cygwin installation.  The default for
new mounts is text mode ("textmode"), which is also the mode for all
"cygdrive" mounts.
</p><p>You can change the default <tt class="literal">cygdrive</tt> prefix and whether it is
binmode or textmode using the <tt class="literal">mount</tt> command.  For example,
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ mount -b --change-cygdrive-prefix cygdrive

will change all <tt class="literal">/cygdrive/...</tt> mounts to binmode.

Agnitum Outpost did not work with Cygwin.  If you are having strange
connection-related problems, disabling the firewall is a good
troubleshooting step (as is closing or disabling all other running
applications, especially resource-intensive processes such as indexed

</p><p>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is used.  The few rare
exceptions have to do with socket code.
Cygwin uses sockets to implement many of its functions, such as IPC.
Some overzealous firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock
stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
throughout.  Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with examples
of poorly written firewall-type software that causes things to break.

/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> know what you are doing.
</p><p>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.
</p><p>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.
</p><p>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <span class="emphasis"><em>So don't do this!</em></span>
</p><p>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.
