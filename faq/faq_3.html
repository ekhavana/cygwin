</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC9">Installing the binary release:</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Important!  Be sure to remove any older versions of the Cygwin tools
from your PATH environment variable so you do not execute them by
mistake.

</P>
<P>
To download the cygwin files, you may use whatever ftp, browser, or
other transfer program you are familiar with.  To download multiple
files without interaction, you may wish to try the <CODE>wget</CODE>
program.  Visit the cygwin home page's software listings to find a
pre-built copy of it.

</P>
<P>
Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the directory
containing the latest release.  A list of mirror sites is at:

</P>
<P>
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html</a></TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you want the development tools and the programs necessary to run
the GNU configure mechanism, you should download the full binary release
called <TT>`full.exe'</TT>.  If you only care about the user tools
listed above, download <TT>`usertools.exe'</TT> instead.

</P>
<P>
If you have an unreliable connection, download the appropriate binary in
smaller chunks instead.  For the split cdk installer, get the files in
the <TT>`full-split'</TT> subdirectory.  Once downloaded, combine the
split files at the command prompt by doing a:

</P>

<PRE>
copy /b xaa + xab + xac + ... + xak + xal full.exe
del xa*.*
</PRE>

<P>
A similar process can be used for the user tools.

</P>
<P>
Once you have an install executable on your system, run it.  If
a previous version of the software is detected, it will offer to
uninstall it for you.

</P>
<P>
Next it will ask you to choose an install location.  The default is
<TT>`&#60;system-drive&#62;:\cygnus\cygwin-b20'</TT>.  Feel free to choose another
location if you would prefer.

</P>
<P>
Finally, it will ask you for the name of the Program Files folder
shortcut to add.  By default, the installer will create
a <TT>`Cygwin B20'</TT> entry in a
folder called <TT>`Cygnus Solutions'</TT>.  When this step is completed, it
will install the tools and exit.

</P>
<P>
At this point, you should be able to look under the start menu and
select "Cygwin B20".  This will pop up a bash shell with all special
environment variables set up for you.  If you are running Windows 95 or
98 and are faced with the error message "Out of environment space", you
need to increase the amount of environment space in your config.sys and
try again.  Adding the line <CODE>shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p</CODE>
should do the trick if <CODE>C:</CODE> is your system drive letter.

</P>
<P>
There are two remaining thing you should do from this prompt.
First, you need to type <CODE>mkdir -p /tmp</CODE> to ensure that a directory
for temporary files exists for programs that expect to find one there.

</P>
<P>
Second, if you are installing the full distribution
(<TT>`full.exe'</TT>), various programs will need to be able to find
<TT>`/bin/sh'</TT>.  You should <TT>`mkdir -p /bin'</TT> and put a copy of
<TT>`sh.exe'</TT> there, removing the older version, if present.  You can
use the <TT>`mount'</TT> utility to select which drive letter is mounted as
<TT>`/'</TT>. See the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for more
information on <TT>`mount'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC10">Installing the source code</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Before downloading the source code corresponding to the release,
you should install the latest release of the tools (either the full
release or just the user tools).

</P>
<P>
Create the directory that will house the source code.  <TT>`cd'</TT>
there.

</P>
<P>
Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the directory
containing the latest release.  A list of mirror sites is at:

</P>
<P>
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html</a></TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you want the user tools source code, <TT>`cd'</TT> into the
<TT>`user-src-split'</TT> subdirectory.  Download the files there.  If you
want the development tools sources, <TT>`cd'</TT> into the
<TT>`dev-src-split'</TT> subdirectory.  Download the files there.

</P>
<P>
Back in the Windows command shell, for the user tools source:

</P>

<PRE>
copy /b xba + xbb + xbc + xbd + xbe + xbf + xbg user-src.tar.bz2
del xb*.*
bunzip2 user-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf user-src.tar
</PRE>

<P>
For the development tools source:

</P>

<PRE>
copy /b xca + xcb + xcc + xcd + ... + xck + xcl dev-src.tar.bz2
del xc*.*
bunzip2 dev-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf dev-src.tar
</PRE>

<P>
Both expand into a directory called <TT>`src'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note: if you want the sources corresponding to everything in the
full.exe binary installer, you will need to download and expand both
the user-src.tar.bz2 and dev-src.tar.bz2 source archives!

</P>
<P>
And you should be done...

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC11">Upgrading to B20.1</A></H2>

<P>
<STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.  Even the section's title is wrong!)</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
If you downloaded the original B20.0 release, you should definitely at
least upgrade the Cygwin library to the version present in B20.1.  To do
this, download the file
<TT>`cygwin-b20/cygwin1-20.1.dll.bz2'</TT> from one of our mirror sites,
decompress it with bunzip2, and then install the dll, replacing
the file cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin/cygwin1.dll in your original
installation of 20.0.

</P>
<P>
There are some additional patches in a few of the other tools
(including a gcc change that makes -mno-cygwin find the correct header
files).  In addition, the tools have been built with a compiled-in path
of /cygnus/cygwin-b20/ which will make some tools such as bison find
their library files without help from environment variables.
To install the full 20.1 release, you will need to download the
correct installer from scratch.  It will offer to uninstall the existing
release and replace it with 20.1 (You should choose to uninstall b20 and
proceed).

</P>
<P>
We have diff files on the ftp site that can be used to upgrade the
original B20.0 sources.  20.0-20.1-dev-src.diff.bz2 upgrades the
development tools sources.  20.0-20.1-user-src.diff.bz2 upgrades the
user tools sources.  They come compressed so you'll need to bunzip2 them
before proceeding.  As an example, if the development tools are in the
directory called "src" and the patch is in the directory above it, apply
the patch as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
cd src
patch -p1 -E &#60; ../20.0-20.1-dev-src.diff
</PRE>
