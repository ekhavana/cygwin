			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU
			development tools for Microsoft Windows. They run thanks to the
			Cygwin library which provides the UNIX system calls and
			environment these programs expect. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>With these tools installed, it is possible to write
			Win32 console or GUI applications that make use of the standard
			Microsoft Win32 API and/or the Cygwin API. As a result, it is
			possible to easily port many significant Unix programs without the
			need for extensive changes to the source code. This includes
			configuring and building most of the available GNU software
			(including the packages included with the Cygwin development tools
			themselves). Even if the development tools are of little to no use
			to you, you may have interest in the many standard Unix utilities
			provided with the package. They can be used both from the bash
			shell (provided) or from the standard Windows command shell.

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cygwin can be expected to run on all modern 32 bit
			versions of Windows, except Windows CE. This includes Windows
			95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003 and the WOW64 32 bit environment on
			released 64 bit versions of Windows. As far as we know no one is
			working on a native 64 bit version of Cygwin. Since Cygwin is a
			community-supported free software project, patches to provide
			support for other versions would be thoughtfully considered. Paid

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Yes. Parts are GNU software (gcc, gas, ld, etc...),

			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>In particular, if you intend to port a proprietary

			project mailing list cygwin@cygwin.com. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note that when we say &quot;free&quot; we mean
			freedom, not price. The goal of such freedom is that the people
			who use a given piece of software should be able to change it to
			fit their needs, learn from it, share it with their friends, etc.
			The Cygwin license allows you those freedoms, so it is free
			software.

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Geoffrey Noer took over the Cygwin project from its

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Steve Chamberlain designed and implemented Cygwin in

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>There is only one recommended way to install Cygwin,

			Cygwin Setup may be found at

						</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you do it any other way, you're on your own! That
			said, keep in mind that the GUI installer is a &quot;work in
			progress&quot;, so there might be a few difficulties, especially
			if you are behind a firewall or have other specific requirements.
			If something doesn't work right for you, and it's not covered here
			or in the latest development snapshot at <A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup/" TARGET="_top">http://cygwin.com/setup/</A>,
			then by all means report it to the mailing list.

				name</TT>, where <TT>name</TT> is the name of the service. Then
				use <TT>cygrunsrv -R name</TT> to uninstall the service from the
				registry. Repeat this for all services that you installed. Common
				services that might have been installed are <TT>sshd</TT>, <TT>cron</TT>,
				<TT>cygserver</TT>, <TT>inetd</TT>, <TT>apache</TT>, and so on. 
				</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Stop the X11 server if it is running, and
				terminate any Cygwin programs that might be running in the
				background. Remove all mount information by typing <TT>umount -A</TT>
				and then exit the command prompt and ensure that no Cygwin
				processes remain. Note: If you want to save your mount points for
				a later reinstall, first save the output of <TT>mount -m</TT> as
				described at
				<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount" TARGET="_top">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount</A>.
								</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Delete the Cygwin root folder and all
				subfolders. If you get an error that an object is in use, then
				ensure that you've stopped all services and closed all Cygwin
				programs. If you get a 'Permission Denied' error then you will
				need to modify the permissions and/or ownership of the files or
				folders that are causing the error. For example, sometimes files
				used by system services end up owned by the SYSTEM account and
				not writable by regular users. 
				</P>
				<P ALIGN=LEFT>The quickest way to delete the entire tree if you
				run into this problem is to change the ownership of all files and
				folders to your account. To do this in Windows Explorer, right
				click on the root Cygwin folder, choose Properties, then the
				Security tab. Select Advanced, then go to the Owner tab and make
				sure your account is listed as the owner. Select the 'Replace
				owner on subcontainers and objects' checkbox and press Ok. After
				Explorer applies the changes you should be able to delete the
				entire tree in one operation. Note that you can also achieve this
				in Cygwin by typing <TT>chown -R user /</TT> or by using other
				tools such as CACLS.EXE. 
				</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Delete the Cygwin shortcuts on the Desktop and
				Start Menu, and anything left by setup.exe in the download
				directory. However, if you plan to reinstall Cygwin it's a good
				idea to keep your setup.exe download directory since you can
				reinstall the packages left in its cache without redownloading
				them. 
				</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>If you added Cygwin to your system path, you
				should remove it unless you plan to reinstall Cygwin to the same
				location. Similarly, if you set your CYGWIN environment variable
				system-wide and don't plan to reinstall, you should remove it. 
				</P>
				<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Finally, if you want to be thorough you can
				delete the registry tree <TT>Software\Cygnus Solutions</TT> under
				<TT>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</TT> and/or <TT>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</TT>.
				However, if you followed the directions above you will have
				already removed all the mount information which is typically the
				only thing stored in the registry.

		<TD></TD>
		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You have some flexibility here. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cygwin has a builtin &quot;cygdrive prefix&quot; for
			drives that are not mounted. You can access any drive, say Z:, as
			'/cygdrive/z/'. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the
			familiar windows &lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes
			('/') instead of Windows backward-slashes ('\'). (But see the
			warning below!) This maps in the obvious way to the Windows path,
			but will be converted internally to use the Cygwin path, following
			mounts (default or explicit). For example: 
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="text-align: left">        bash$ cd C:/Windows
        bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>

			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="text-align: left">        bash$ cd C:/cygwin
        bash$ pwd
        /</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
			for a default setup. You could also use backward-slashes in the
			Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Warning:</B> There is some ambiguity in going
			from a Windows path to the posix path, because different posix
			paths, through different mount points, could map to the same
			Windows directory. This matters because different mount points may
			be binmode or textmode, so the behavior of Cygwin apps will vary
			depending on the posix path used to get there. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and
			avoid typing &quot;/cygdrive&quot;, by explicitly mounting drives
			to posix paths. For example: 
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="text-align: left">        bash$ mkdir /c
        bash$ mount c:/ /c
        bash$ ls /c</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
			Then <TT>/cygdrive/c/Windows</TT> becomes <TT>/c/Windows</TT>
			which is a little less typing. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note that you only need to mount drives once. The
			mapping is kept in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much
			indefinitely. You can only get rid of them with umount, or the
			registry editor. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in
			binary mode (&quot;binmode&quot;) where text and binary files are
			treated equivalently. This should only be necessary for badly
			ported Unix programs where binary flags are missing from open
			calls. It is also the setting for /, /usr/bin and /usr/lib in a
			default Cygwin installation. The default for new mounts is text
			mode (&quot;textmode&quot;), which is also the mode for all
			&quot;cygdrive&quot; mounts. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can change the default <TT>cygdrive</TT> prefix
			and whether it is binmode or textmode using the <TT>mount</TT>
			command. For example, 
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in; text-align: left">        bash$ mount -b --change-cygdrive-prefix cygdrive</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is

			uses sockets to implement many of its functions, such as IPC. Some
			overzealous firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock
			stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
			throughout. Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Yes! Use rxvt instead. It's an optional package in

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>&quot;Out of queue slots!&quot; generally occurs

			up these files with the supposition that it will be possible to
			delete these files in the future. Assuming that the permission of
			an affected file does change later on, the file will be deleted as
			requested. However, if too many requests come in to delete
			inaccessible files, the queue overflows and you get the message
			you're asking about. Usually you can remedy this with a quick
			chmod, close of a file, or other such thing. (Thanks to Larry Hall

		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Let's start with some background. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>In UNIX, a file is a file and what the file contains
			is whatever the program/programmer/user told it to put into it. In
			Windows, a file is also a file and what the file contains depends
			not only on the program/programmer/user but also the file
			processing mode. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>When processing in text mode, certain values of data
			are treated specially. A \n (new line) written to the file will
			prepend a \r (carriage return) so that if you `printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;)
			you in fact get &quot;Hello\r\n&quot;. Upon reading this
			combination, the \r is removed and the number of bytes returned by
			the read is 1 less than was actually read. This tends to confuse
			programs dependent on ftell() and fseek(). A Ctrl-Z encountered
			while reading a file sets the End Of File flags even though it
			truly isn't the end of file. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to
			easily mix Cygwin-ported Unix programs with generic Windows
			programs. As a result, Cygwin opens files in text mode as is
			normal under Windows. In the accompanying tools, tools that deal
			with binaries (e.g. objdump) operate in Unix binary mode and tools
			that deal with text files (e.g. bash) operate in text mode. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Some people push the notion of globally setting the
			default processing mode to binary via mount point options or by
			setting the CYGWIN environment variable. But that creates a
			different problem. In binary mode, the program receives all of the
			data in the file, including a \r. Since the programs will no
			longer deal with these properly for you, you would have to remove
			the \r from the relevant text files, especially scripts and
			startup resource files. This is a porter &quot;cop out&quot;,
			forcing the user to deal with the \r for the porter. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is rather easy for the porter to fix the source
			code by supplying the appropriate file processing mode switches to
			the open/fopen functions. Treat all text files as text and treat
			all binary files as binary. To be specific, you can select binary
			mode by adding <TT>O_BINARY</TT> to the second argument of an <TT>open</TT>
			call, or <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> to second argument of an <TT>fopen</TT>
			call. You can also call <TT>setmode (fd, O_BINARY)</TT>. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note that because the open/fopen switches are
			defined by ANSI, they exist under most flavors of Unix; open/fopen
			will just ignore the switch since they have no meaning to UNIX.

		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cygwin fork() essentially works like a non-copy on

			Because of this it can be a little slow. In most cases, you are
			better off using the spawn family of calls if possible. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Here's how it works: 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process
			table for child. Parent creates child suspended using Win32
			CreateProcess call, giving the same path it was invoked with
			itself. Parent calls setjmp to save its own context and then sets
			a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared memory area (shared among
			all Cygwin tasks). Parent fills in the child's .data and .bss
			subsections by copying from its own address space into the
			suspended child's address space. Parent then starts the child.
			Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point. Child starts
			and discovers if has been forked and then longjumps using the
			saved jump buffer. Child sets mutex parent is waiting on and then
			blocks on another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its stack
			and heap. Parent notices child is in safe area, copies stack and
			heap from itself into child, releases the mutex the child is
			waiting on and returns from the fork call. Child wakes from
			blocking on mutex, recreates any mmapped areas passed to it via
			shared area and then returns from fork itself.

	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD></TD>
		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cygwin knows of two ways to create symlinks. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The old method is the only valid one up to but not
			including version 1.3.0. If it's enabled (from 1.3.0 on by setting
			`nowinsymlinks' in the environment variable CYGWIN) Cygwin
			generates link files with a magic header. When you open a file or
			directory that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file or
			directory listed in the magic header. Because we don't want to
			have to open every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin
			marks symlinks with the system attribute. Files without the system
			attribute are not checked. Because remote samba filesystems do not
			enable the system attribute by default, symlinks do not work on
			network drives unless you explicitly enable this attribute. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The new method which is introduced with Cygwin
			version 1.3.0 is enabled by default or if `winsymlinks' is set in
			the environment variable CYGWIN. Using this method, Cygwin
			generates symlinks by creating Windows shortcuts. Cygwin created
			shortcuts have a special header (which is in that way never
			created by Explorer) and the R/O attribute set. A DOS path is
			stored in the shortcut as usual and the description entry is used
			to store the POSIX path. While the POSIX path is stored as is, the
			DOS path has perhaps to be rearranged to result in a valid path.
			This may result in a divergence between the DOS and the POSIX path
			when symlinks are moved crossing mount points. When a user changes
			the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin and it will only use
			the DOS path then. While Cygwin shortcuts are shown without the
			&quot;.lnk&quot; suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin shortcuts are
			shown with the suffix. However, both are treated as symlinks. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Both, the old and the new symlinks can live
			peacefully together since Cygwin treats both as symlinks
			regardless of the setting of `(no)winsymlinks' in the environment
			variable CYGWIN.

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you are porting an application which already uses
			Winsock, then using the net support in Cygwin is wrong. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>But you can still use native Winsock, and use

	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD></TD>
		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cygwin versioning is relatively complicated because
			of its status as a shared library. First of all, since October
			1998 every Cygwin DLL has been named <TT>cygwin1.dll</TT> and has
			a 1 in the release name. Additionally, there are DLL major and
			minor numbers that correspond to the name of the release, and a
			release number. In other words, cygwin-1.5.10-2 is <TT>cygwin1.dll</TT>,
			major version 5, minor version 10, release 2. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The <TT>cygwin1.dll</TT> major version number gets
			incremented only when a change is made that makes existing
			software incompatible. For example, the first major version 5
			release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added 64-bit file I/O operations, which
			required many libraries to be recompiled and relinked. The minor
			version changes every time we make a new backward compatible
			Cygwin release available. There is also a <TT>cygwin1.dll</TT>
			release version number. The release number is only incremented if
			we update an existing release in a way that does not effect the
			DLL (like a missing header file). 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers.
			The major number tracks important non-backward-compatible
			interface changes to the API. An executable linked with an earlier
			major number will not be compatible with the latest DLL. The minor
			number tracks significant API additions or changes that will not
			break older executables but may be required by newly compiled
			ones. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Then there is a shared memory region compatibility
			version number. It is incremented when incompatible changes are
			made to the shared memory region or to any named shared mutexes,
			semaphores, etc. Finally there is a mount point registry version
			number which keeps track of non-backwards-compatible changes to
			the registry mount table layout. This has been <TT>mounts v2</TT>
			for a long time. For more exciting Cygwin version number details,
			check out the <TT>/usr/include/cygwin/version.h</TT> file.

			<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>(Please note: This section has not yet been

			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>It's pretty simple actually. Cygwin tools require
			that you explicitly link the import libraries for whatever Win32
			API functions that you are going to use, with the exception of
			kernel32, which is linked automatically (because the startup
			and/or built-in code uses it). 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you
			must link with gdi32 like this: 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>or (compiling and linking in one step): 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The following libraries are available for use in
			this way: 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>advapi32 largeint ole32 scrnsave vfw32 cap lz32
			oleaut32 shell32 win32spl comctl32 mapi32 oledlg snmp winmm

			glu32 netapi32 rpcdce4 user32 wst icmp odbc32 rpcndr uuid imm32
			odbccp32 rpcns4 vdmdbg kernel32 oldnames rpcrt4 version 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The regular setup allows you to use the option
			-mwindows on the command line to include a set of the basic
			libraries (and also make your program a GUI program instead of a
			console program), including user32, gdi32 and, IIRC, comdlg32. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note that you should never include -lkernel32 on
			your link line unless you are invoking ld directly. Do not include
			the same import library twice on your link line. Finally, it is a
			good idea to put import libraries last on your link line, or at
			least after all the object files and static libraries that
			reference them. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The first two are related to problems the linker has
			(as of b18 at least) when import libraries are referenced twice.
			Tables get messed up and programs crash randomly. The last point
			has to do with the fact that gcc processes the files listed on the
			command line in sequence and will only resolve references to
			libraries if they are given after the file that makes the
			reference.

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>First, you need to get the Cygwin source. Ideally,

			(<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cvs.html" TARGET="_top">http://cygwin.com/cvs.html</A>).
			This is the <EM>preferred method</EM> for acquiring the sources.
			Otherwise, you can install the cygwin source package from the
			distribution. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you are trying to duplicate a cygwin release then
			you should just download the corresponding source package and use
			&quot;tar xjf&quot; to unpack it. This will unpack the sources
			into a directory named cygwin-x.y.z-n, where x.y.z-n correspond to
			the version numbering of the tar.bz2 package. 
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="text-align: left">tar xjf cygwin-1.5.12-1-src.tar.bz2
cd cygwin-1.5.12-1</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
			You <EM>must</EM> build cygwin in a separate directory from the
			source, so create something like a <TT>build/</TT> directory. You
			will also want to install to a temporary location: 
			</P>
			<PRE CLASS="screen" STYLE="text-align: left">mkdir build
mkdir /install 
cd build
(../configure --prefix=/install -v; make) &gt;&amp; make.out
make install &gt; install.log 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
			Normally, this procedure ignore errors in building the
			documentation. which requires the <TT>docbook-xml</TT>,
			<TT>docbook-xsl</TT>, and <TT>xmlto</TT> packages. For more
			information on building the documentation, see the README included
			in the cygwin-doc package. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>To check a cygwin1.dll, run &quot;make check&quot;
			in the winsup/testsuite directory. If that works, install
			everything <EM>except</EM> the dll (if you can). Then, close down
			all cygwin programs (including bash windows, inetd, etc.), save
			your old dll, and copy the new dll to the correct place. Then
			start up a bash window, or run a cygwin program from the Windows
			command prompt, and see what happens. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you get the error &quot;shared region is
			corrupted&quot; it means that two different versions of
			cygwin1.dll are running on your machine at the same time. Remove
			all but one.

$(LD) EXPFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY</PRE><P ALIGN=LEFT>
			In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>$(AS) is the assembler, as. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create,
			e.g., tcl80.dll. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>OBJS is the list of object files you want to put
			into the DLL. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the
			DLL against. For example, you may or may not want -lcygwin. You
			may want -lkernel32. Tcl links against -lcygwin -ladvapi32
			-luser32 -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -lkernel32. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file. A
			simple DEFFILE would consist of ``EXPORTS'' followed by a list of
			all symbols which should be exported from the DLL. Each symbol
			should be on a line by itself. Other programs will only be able to
			access the listed symbols. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>BASEFILE is a temporary file that is used during
			this five stage process, e.g., tcl.base. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>EXPFILE is another temporary file, e.g., tcl.exp. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to
			use as the entry point. This function should be defined using the
			WINAPI attribute, and should take three arguments: int WINAPI
			startup (HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID) 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>This means that the actual symbol name will have an
			appended @12, so if your entry point really is named <TT>startup</TT>,
			the string you should use for ENTRY in the above examples would be
			<TT>startup@12</TT>. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the
			entry function will need to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer.
			You can do that by declaring a global variable <TT>_impure_ptr</TT>,
			and then initializing it in the entry function. Be careful not to
			export the global variable <TT>_impure_ptr</TT> from your DLL;
			that is, do not put it in DEFFILE.

			You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines.
			The Tcl build does this, but I admit that I no longer remember
			whether this is important. Note that if you specify a --subsytem
			&lt;x&gt; flag to ld, the -e entry must come after the subsystem
			flag, since the subsystem flag sets a different default entry
			point. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on
			the $(LD) lines. This will set the default image base. Programs
			using this DLL will start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a
			different portion of the address space. Each DLL starts at the
			image base, and continues for whatever size it occupies. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to
			build a library so that other programs can link against it. This
			is not required: you could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary.
			However, if you want to be able to link directly against the DLL,
			you need to create a library. Do that like this: 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def

			<P ALIGN=LEFT>$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same
			as above. Make sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or
			things won't work right. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to
			create, e.g., libtcl80.a. You can then link against that library

	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD></TD>
		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are two basic strategies for porting Unix GUIs
			to Windows. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The first is to use a portable graphics library such
			as tcl/tk, X11, or V (and others?). Typically, you will end up
			with a GUI on Windows that requires some runtime support. With
			tcl/tk, you'll want to include the necessary library files and the
			tcl/tk DLLs. In the case of X11, you'll need everyone using your
			program to have an X11 server installed. 
			</P>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The second method is to rewrite your GUI using Win32
			API calls (or MFC with VC++). If your program is written in a
			fairly modular fashion, you may still want to use Cygwin if your
			program contains a lot of shared (non-GUI-related) code. That way
			you still gain some of the portability advantages inherent in
			using Cygwin.

		<TD></TD>
		<TD>
			<P ALIGN=LEFT>DJGPP is a similar idea, but for DOS instead of
			Win32. DJGPP uses a &quot;DOS extender&quot; to provide a more
			reasonable operating interface for its applications. The Cygwin
			toolset doesn't have to do this since all of the applications are
			native WIN32. Applications compiled with the Cygwin tools can
			access the Win32 API functions, so you can write programs which
			use the Windows GUI.
