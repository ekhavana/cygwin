<P>The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools
for Microsoft Windows. They run thanks to the Cygwin library which
provides the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect.
</P>
<P>With these tools installed, it is possible to write Win32 console
or GUI applications that make use of the standard Microsoft Win32 API
and/or the Cygwin API. As a result, it is possible to easily port
many significant Unix programs without the need for extensive changes
to the source code. This includes configuring and building most of
the available GNU software (including the packages included with the
Cygwin development tools themselves). Even if the development tools
are of little to no use to you, you may have interest in the many
standard Unix utilities provided with the package. They can be used
both from the bash shell (provided) or from the standard Windows
command shell.

<P>Wait a minute... Cygwin is only <EM>supported</EM> if you are
paying for it, such as through a support contract with Red Hat. For
information about getting a Red Hat support contract, see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/</A></STRONG>.
</P>
<P>That said, Cygwin can be expected to run on all modern 32 bit
versions of Windows, except Windows CE. This includes Windows
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP. 
</P>
<P>Keep in mind that Cygwin can only do as much as the underlying OS
supports. Because of this, Cygwin will behave differently, and
exhibit different limitations, on the various versions of Windows. 
</P>
<H2><A HREF="#TOC3" NAME="SEC3">Where can I get it?</A></H2>
<P>The home page for the Cygwin project is <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A></STRONG>.
There you should find everything you need for Cygwin, including links
for download and setup, a current list of mirror sites, a User's
Guide, an API Reference, mailing lists and archives, and additional
ported software. 
</P>
<P>You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/manual/">http://www.fsf.org/manual/</A></STRONG>.
(You should read GNU manuals from a local mirror. Check
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html">http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html</A></STRONG>
for a list of them.) 
</P>
<H2><A HREF="#TOC4" NAME="SEC4">Is it free software?</A></H2>
<P>Yes. Parts are GNU software (gcc, gas, ld, etc...), parts are
covered by the standard X11 license, some of it is public domain,
some of it was written by Cygnus and placed under the GPL. None of it
is shareware. You don't have to pay anyone to use it but you should
be sure to read the copyright section of the FAQ for more information
on how the GNU General Public License may affect your use of these
tools. 
</P>
<P>In particular, if you intend to port a proprietary (non-GPL'd)
application using Cygwin, you will need the proprietary-use license
for the Cygwin library. This is available for purchase; please visit
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/</A></STRONG>
for more information. All other questions should be sent to the
project mailing list <A HREF="mailto:cygwin@cygwin.com">cygwin@cygwin.com</A>.
</P>
<P>Note that when we say &quot;free&quot; we mean freedom, not price.
The goal of such freedom is that the people who use a given piece of
software should be able to change it to fit their needs, learn from
it, share it with their friends, etc. The Cygwin license allows you
those freedoms, so it is free software. 
</P>
<H2><A HREF="#TOC5" NAME="SEC5">What version of Cygwin <EM>is</EM>
this, anyway?</A></H2>
<P>To find the version of the Cygwin DLL installed, you can use
<TT>`uname'</TT> as on Linux or <TT>`cygcheck'</TT>. Refer to each
command's <SAMP>`--help'</SAMP> output and the <A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/">Cygwin
User's Guide</A> for more information. 
</P>
<P>If you are looking for the version number for the whole Cygwin
release, there is none. Each package in the Cygwin release has its
own version. The packages in Cygwin are continually improving, thanks
to the efforts of net volunteers who maintain the Cygwin binary
ports. Each package has its own version numbers and its own release
process. 
</P>
<P>So, how do you get the most up-to-date version of Cygwin? Easy.
Just download the Cygwin Setup program from
<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">http://cygwin.com/setup.exe</A>.
This program will handle the task of updating the packages on your
system to the latest version. For more information about using

<H1><A HREF="#TOC6" NAME="SEC6">Installation Instructions</A></H1>
<H2><A HREF="#TOC7" NAME="SEC7">Contents</A></H2>
<P>There is only one recommended way to install Cygwin, which is to
use the GUI installer &quot;Cygwin Setup&quot;. It is flexible and
easy to use. You can pick and choose the packages you wish to
install, and update them individually. Full source code is available
for all packages and tools. More information on using Cygwin Setup
may be found at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html</A></STRONG>.
</P>
<P>If you do it any other way, you're on your own! That said, keep in
mind that the GUI installer is a &quot;work in progress&quot;, so
there might be a few difficulties, especially if you are behind a
firewall or have other specific requirements. If something doesn't
work right for you, and it's not covered here or in the latest
development snapshot at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup/">http://cygwin.com/setup/</A></STRONG>,
then by all means report it to the mailing list.

Cygwin, see <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/">http://cygwin.com/packages/</A></STRONG>.

<H2><A HREF="#TOC8" NAME="SEC8">Installation using &quot;Cygwin
Setup&quot;</A></H2>
<P>The Cygwin Setup program is the <EM>only</EM> recommended way to
install Cygwin. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC9" NAME="SEC9">Why not install in C:\?</A></H3>
<P>The Cygwin Setup program will prompt you for a &quot;root&quot;
directory. The default is <SAMP>`C:\cygwin'</SAMP>, but you can
change it. You are urged not to choose something like <SAMP>`C:\'</SAMP>
(the root directory on the system drive) for your Cygwin root. If you
do, then critical Cygwin system directories like <SAMP>`etc'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`bin'</SAMP> could easily be corrupted
by other (non-Cygwin) applications or packages that use <SAMP>`\etc'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`\lib'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`\bin'</SAMP>. Perhaps there is no
conflict now, but who knows what you might install in the future?
It's also just good common sense to segregate your Cygwin
&quot;filesystems&quot; from the rest of your Windows system disk. 
</P>
<P>(In the past, there had been genuine bugs that would cause
problems for people who installed in <SAMP>`C:\'</SAMP>, but we
believe those are gone now.) 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC10" NAME="SEC10">Can I use Cygwin Setup to get old
versions of packages (like gcc-2.95)?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin Setup can be used to install any packages that are on a
Cygwin mirror, which usually includes one version previous to the
current one. The complete list may be searched at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/">http://cygwin.com/packages/</A></STRONG>.
There is no complete archive of older packages. If you have a problem
with the current version of a Cygwin package, please report it to the
mailing list using the guidelines at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/problems.html">http://cygwin.com/problems.html</A></STRONG>.
</P>
<P>That said, if you really need an older package, you may be able to
find an outdated or archival mirror by searching the web for an old
package version (for example, <SAMP>`gcc2-2.95.3-10-src.tar.bz2'</SAMP>),
but keep in mind that this older version will not be supported by the
mailing list and that installing the older version will not help
improve Cygwin. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC11" NAME="SEC11">Is Cygwin Setup, or one of the
packages, infected with a virus?</A></H3>
<P>Unlikely. Unless you can confirm it, please don't report it to the

positives when extracting compressed tar archives. If this causes
problems for you, consider disabling your anti-virus software when
running <CODE>setup</CODE>. Read the next entry for a fairly safe way

<P>If you upgraded recently, and suddenly vim (or some other Cygwin

you did not follow these instructions properly:
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2001/msg00124.html">http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2001/msg00124.html</A></STRONG>.
To repair the damage, you must run Cygwin Setup again, and re-install
the <SAMP>`libncurses5'</SAMP> package. 
</P>
<P>Note that Cygwin Setup won't show this option by default. In the
&quot;Select packages to install&quot; dialog, click on the
<SAMP>`Full/Part'</SAMP> button. This lists all packages, even those
that are already installed. Scroll down to locate the <SAMP>`libncurses5'</SAMP>
package. Click on the &quot;cycle&quot; glyph until it says
&quot;Reinstall&quot;. Continue with the installation. 
</P>
<P>Similarly, if something cannot find <CODE>cygintl.dll</CODE>, then
run Cygwin Setup and re-install the <SAMP>`libintl'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`libintl1'</SAMP> packages.

<H3><A HREF="#TOC32" NAME="SEC32">Why is Cygwin suddenly <EM>so</EM>
slow?</A></H3>
<P>If you recently upgraded and suddenly <EM>every</EM> command takes
a <EM>very</EM> long time, then something is probably attempting to
access a network share. You may have the obsolete <CODE>//c</CODE>
notation in your PATH or startup files. This now means the <EM>network
share</EM> <CODE>c</CODE>, which will slow things down tremendously
if it does not exist. 
</P>
<P>Using //c (for C:) doesn't work anymore. (Similarly for any drive
letter, e.g. <CODE>//z</CODE> for <CODE>Z:</CODE>) This &quot;feature&quot;
has long been deprecated, and no longer works at all in the latest
release. As of release 1.3.3, <CODE>//c</CODE> now means the <EM>network

<H3><A HREF="#TOC33" NAME="SEC33">Why don't my services work (or
access network shares)?</A></H3>
<P>Most Windows services run as a special user called <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP>.
If you installed Cygwin for &quot;Just Me&quot;, the <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP>
user won't see your Cygwin mount table. You need to re-mount all of
your mounts as &quot;system&quot; for services to work. You can
re-run <SAMP>`setup.exe'</SAMP> and select &quot;Install for All
Users&quot;, or this script will do the trick: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">eval &quot;`mount -m | sed -e 's/ -u / -s /g' -e 's/$/;/'`&quot;</PRE><P>
The <SAMP>`SYSTEM'</SAMP> user cannot access network shares that
require authentication. For more information, see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html</A></STRONG>.
</P>
<P>Workarounds include using public network share that does not
require authentication (for non-critical files), or running the
service as your own user with <SAMP>`cygrunsrv -u'</SAMP> (see
<SAMP>`/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/cygrunsrv.README'</SAMP> for more
information). 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC34" NAME="SEC34">How should I set my PATH?</A></H3>
<P>This is done for you in the file /etc/profile, which is sourced by
bash when you start it from the Desktop or Start Menu shortcut,
created by <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>. The line is 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        PATH=&quot;/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH&quot;</PRE><P>
Effectively, this <STRONG>prepends</STRONG> /usr/local/bin and
/usr/bin to your Windows system path. If you choose to reset your
PATH, say in $HOME/.bashrc, or by editing etc/profile directly, then
you should follow this rule. You <STRONG>must</STRONG> have <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>
in your PATH <STRONG>before</STRONG> any Windows system directories.
(And you must not omit the Windows system directories!) Otherwise you
will likely encounter all sorts of problems running Cygwin
applications. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC35" NAME="SEC35">Bash says &quot;command not found&quot;,
but it's right there!</A></H3>
<P>If you compile a program, you might find that you can't run it: 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ gcc -o hello hello.c
        bash$ hello
        bash: hello: command not found</PRE><P>
Unlike Windows, bash does not look for programs in <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
(the current directory) by default. You can add <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> to
your PATH (see above), but this is not recommended (at least on UNIX)
for security reasons. Just tell bash where to find it, when you type
it on the command line: 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ gcc -o hello hello.c
        bash$ ./hello
        Hello World!</PRE><H3>
<A HREF="#TOC36" NAME="SEC36">How do I convert between Windows and
UNIX paths?</A></H3>
<P>Use the 'cygpath' utility. Type '<CODE>cygpath --help</CODE>' for
information. For example (on my installation): 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ cygpath --windows ~/.bashrc
        D:\starksb\.bashrc
        bash$ cygpath --unix C:/cygwin/bin/cygwin.bat
        /usr/bin/cygwin.bat
        bash$ cygpath --unix C:\\cygwin\\bin\\cygwin.bat
        /usr/bin/cygwin.bat</PRE><P>
Note that bash interprets the backslash '\' as an escape character,
so you must type it twice in the bash shell if you want it to be
recognized as such. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC37" NAME="SEC37">Why doesn't bash read my .bashrc
file on startup?</A></H3>
<P>Your .bashrc is read from your home directory specified by the
HOME environment variable. It uses /.bashrc if HOME is not set. So
you need to set HOME correctly, or move your .bashrc to the top of
the drive mounted as / in Cygwin. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC38" NAME="SEC38">How can I get bash filename
completion to be case insensitive?</A></H3>
<P>Add the following to your <CODE>~/.bashrc</CODE> file:

<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        set completion-ignore-case on</PRE><H3>
<A HREF="#TOC39" NAME="SEC39">Can I use paths/filenames containing
spaces in them?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths. That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix. If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in
filenames used by Cygwin tools. 
</P>
<P>In particular, bash interprets space as a word separator. You
would have to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space
character. For example: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        bash-2.03$ cd '/cygdrive/c/Program Files'</PRE><P>
or 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        bash-2.03$ cd /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files</PRE><H3>
<A HREF="#TOC40" NAME="SEC40">Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a
directory?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin versions &lt; 1.3.0 do not follow MS Windows Explorer
Shortcuts (*.lnk files). It sees a shortcut as a regular file and
this you cannot &quot;cd&quot; into it. 
</P>
<P>Since version 1.3.0, Cygwin uses shortcuts as symlinks by default.
</P>
<P>Cygwin shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native
Windows applications. Windows applications can usually make use of
Cygwin shortcuts but not vice versa. This is by choice. The reason is
that Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which
would get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts
them as symlinks. 
</P>
<P>Changing a Cygwin shortcut in Windows Explorer usually changes a
Cygwin shortcut into a Windows native shortcut. Afterwards, Cygwin
will not recognize it as symlink anymore. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC41" NAME="SEC41">I'm having basic problems with
find. Why?</A></H3>
<P>Make sure you are using the find that came with Cygwin and that
you aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead. You can verify
that you are getting the right one by doing a &quot;type find&quot;
in bash. 
</P>
<P>If the path argument to find, including current directory
(default), is itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it
unless you specify the <SAMP>`-follow'</SAMP> option. This behavior
is different than most other UNIX implementations, but is not likely
to change. 
</P>
<P>If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to
be missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem
with one of find's optimisations. The absence of <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`..'</SAMP> directories on some filesystems, such as DVD-R UDF,
can confuse find. See the documentation for the option <SAMP>`-noleaf'</SAMP>
in the man page. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC42" NAME="SEC42">Why doesn't <SAMP>`su'</SAMP> work?</A></H3>

<P>Or, it could be a permission problem, and Cygwin doesn't
understand that your script is executable. Because <SAMP>`chmod'</SAMP>
may not work (see FAQ entry above), Cygwin must read the contents of
files to determine if they are executable. If your script does not
start with 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        #! /bin/sh</PRE><P>

also works.

<P>Note that you can use <SAMP>`mount -x'</SAMP> to force Cygwin to
treat all files under the mount point as executable. This can be used
for individual files as well as directories. Then Cygwin will not

<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for

</P>
<P>Careful examination shows that they not just non-functional, but
rather behave strangely, for example, with NumLock off, keys on
numeric keyboard work, until you press usual cursor keys, when even
numeric stop working, but they start working again after hitting
alphanumeric key, etc. This reported to happen on localized versions
of Win98 and Win95, and not specific to Cygwin; there are known cases
of Alt+Enter (fullscreen/windowed toggle) not working and shifts
sticking with other programs. The cause of this problem is Microsoft
keyboard localizer which by default installed in 'autoexec.bat'.
Corresponding line looks like: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">keyb ru,,C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\keybrd3.sys</PRE><P>
(That's for russian locale.) You should comment that line if you want
your keys working properly. Of course, this will deprive you of your
local alphabet keyboard support, so you should think about another
localizer. ex-USSR users are of course knowledgeable of Keyrus
localizer, and it might work for other locales too, since it has
keyboard layout editor. But it has russian messages and documentation

<H3><A HREF="#TOC50" NAME="SEC50">Is it OK to have multiple copies of
the DLL?</A></H3>
<P>You should only have one copy of the Cygwin DLL on your system. If
you have multiple versions, they will conflict and cause problems. 
</P>
<P>If you get the error &quot;shared region is corrupted&quot; or
&quot;shared region version mismatch&quot; it means you have multiple
versions of cygwin1.dll running at the same time. This could happen,
for example, if you update cygwin1.dll without exiting <EM>all</EM>
Cygwin apps (including inetd) beforehand. 
</P>
<P>The only DLL that is sanctioned by the Cygwin project is the one
that you get by running <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">http://cygwin.com/setup.exe</A></STRONG>,
installed in the directory controlled by this program. If you have
other versions on your system and desire help from the cygwin

by <TT>`setup.exe'</TT>. 
</P>
<P>If you're trying to find multiple versions of the DLL that are
causing this problem, reboot first, in case DLLs still loaded in
memory are the cause. Then use the Windows System find utility to
search your whole machine, not just components in your PATH (as
'type' would do) or cygwin-mounted filesystems (as Cygwin 'find'
would do).

<H3><A HREF="#TOC51" NAME="SEC51">Why isn't package XYZ available in

<P>Probably because there is nobody willing or able to maintain it.
It takes time, and the priority for the Cygwin Team is the Cygwin
package. The rest is a volunteer effort. Want to contribute? See
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</A></STRONG>.

package XYZ older than the version that I installed on my linux
system? Is there something special about Cygwin which requires that

</P>
<P>Every package in the Cygwin distribution has a maintainer who is
responsible for sending out updates of the package. This person is a
volunteer who is rarely the same person as the official developer of
the package. If you notice that a version of a package seems to be
out of date, the reason is usually pretty simple -- the person who is
maintaining the package hasn't gotten around to updating it yet.
Rarely, the newer package actually requires complex changes that the
maintainer is working out. 
</P>
<P>If you urgently need an update, sending a polite message to the
cygwin mailing list pinging the maintainer is perfectly acceptable.
There are no guarantees that the maintainer will have time to update

<H3><A HREF="#TOC53" NAME="SEC53">How can I access other drives?</A></H3>
<P>You have some flexibility here. 
</P>
<P>Cygwin has a builtin &quot;cygdrive prefix&quot; for drives that
are not mounted. You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</P>
<P>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar
windows &lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/')
instead of Windows backward-slashes ('\'). (But see the warning
below!) This maps in the obvious way to the Windows path, but will be
converted internally to use the Cygwin path, following mounts
(default or explicit). For example: 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ cd C:/Windows
        bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows</PRE><P>
and 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ cd C:/cygwin
        bash$ pwd
        /</PRE><P>
for a default setup. You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> There is some ambiguity in going from a
Windows path to the posix path, because different posix paths,
through different mount points, could map to the same Windows
directory. This matters because different mount points may be binmode
or textmode, so the behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on
the posix path used to get there. 
</P>
<P>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
&quot;/cygdrive&quot;, by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.
For example: 
</P>
<PRE>        bash$ mkdir /c
        bash$ mount c:/ /c
        bash$ ls /c</PRE><P>
Then <SAMP>`/cygdrive/c/Windows'</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>`/c/Windows'</SAMP>
which is a little less typing. 
</P>
<P>Note that you only need to mount drives once. The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely. You
can only get rid of them with umount, or the registry editor. 
</P>
<P>The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode
(&quot;binmode&quot;) where text and binary files are treated
equivalently. This should only be necessary for badly ported Unix
programs where binary flags are missing from open calls. It is also
the setting for /, /usr/bin and /usr/lib in a default Cygwin
installation. The default for new mounts is text mode (&quot;textmode&quot;),
which is also the mode for all &quot;cygdrive&quot; mounts. 
</P>
<P>You can change the default <SAMP>`cygdrive'</SAMP> prefix and
whether it is binmode or textmode using the <CODE>mount</CODE>
command. For example, 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">        bash$ mount -b --change-cygdrive-prefix cygdrive</PRE><P>

<A HREF="#TOC55" NAME="SEC55">What firewall should I use with Cygwin?</A></H3>
<P>We have had good reports about Kerio Personal Firewall, ZoneLabs
Integrity Desktop, and the built-in firewall in Windows XP. Other
well-known products including ZoneAlarm and Norton Internet Security
have caused problems for some users but work fine for others. At last
report, Agnitum Outpost did not work with Cygwin. If you are having
strange connection-related problems, disabling the firewall is a good
troubleshooting step (as is closing or disabling all other running
applications, especially resource-intensive processes such as indexed
search). 
</P>
<P>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is used. The few
rare exceptions have to do with socket code. Cygwin uses sockets to
implement many of its functions, such as IPC. Some overzealous
firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock stack (with the
'layered service provider' API) and install hooks throughout. Sadly
the mailing list archives are littered with examples of poorly
written firewall-type software that causes things to break. Note that
with many of these products, simply disabling the firewall does not
remove these changes; it must be completely uninstalled.

<H3><A HREF="#TOC56" NAME="SEC56">How can I share files between Unix

<P>During development, we have both Linux boxes running Samba and
Windows machines. We often build with cross-compilers under Linux and
copy binaries and source to the Windows system or just toy with them
directly off the Samba-mounted partition. On dual-boot NT/Windows 9x

files under Windows 9x. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC57" NAME="SEC57">Is Cygwin case-sensitive? What are
managed mounts?</A></H3>
<P>Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case. A prime example of
this is perl's configuration script, which wants <CODE>Makefile</CODE>
and <CODE>makefile</CODE>. WIN32 can't tell the difference between
files with just different case, so the configuration fails. 
</P>
<P>To help with this problem, starting in <SAMP>`cygwin-1.5.0'</SAMP>
it is possible to have a case sensitive Cygwin managed mount. This is
an experimental feature and should be used with caution. You should
only use it for directories that are initially unpopulated and are
due to be completely managed by cygwin (hence the name). So, the best
use would be to create an empty directory, mount it, and then add
files to it: 
</P>
<PRE>mkdir /managed-dir
mount -o managed c:/cygwin/managed-dir /managed-dir
cd /managed-dir/
touch makefile
touch Makefile</PRE><H3>
<A HREF="#TOC58" NAME="SEC58">What about DOS special filenames?</A></H3>
<P>Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either
as the root filename or as the extension part. If you do, you'll have
trouble. Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting. E.g., the perl distribution has a file called <CODE>aux.sh</CODE>.
The perl configuration tries to make sure that <CODE>aux.sh</CODE> is
there, but an operation on a file with the magic letters 'aux' in it
will hang. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC59" NAME="SEC59">When it hangs, how do I get it

<P>If something goes wrong and the tools hang on you for some reason
(easy to do if you try and read a file called aux.sh), first try
hitting ^C to return to bash or the cmd prompt. 
</P>
<P>If you start up another shell, and applications don't run, it's a
good bet that the hung process is still running somewhere. Use the
Task Manager, pview, or a similar utility to kill the process.

<PRE>        bash$ mount

        C:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type system (binmode)
        C:\cygwin on / type system (binmode)</PRE><P>
(Exactly what you see depends on what options you gave to <CODE>setup.exe</CODE>.)
</P>
<P>Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib
and /usr/lib. This is intentional, and you should not undo these
mounts unless you <EM>really</EM> know what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in
/lib or /usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin). Rather than
distinguish between them and try to keep track of them (possibly
requiring the occasional duplication or symbolic link), it was
decided to maintain only one actual directory, with equivalent ways
to access it. 
</P>
<P>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were
dismissed because they do not always work on Samba drives. Also,
mounts are faster to process because no disk access is required to
resolve them. 
</P>
<P>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts
(or symlinks for that matter). For example, if you use WinZip to
unpack the tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get
installed to the correct Cygwin path. <EM>So don't do this!</EM> 
</P>
<P>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory
the same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are
doing and are prepared to deal with the consequences. It is generally
easier to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say,
C:\. For one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other
(non-cygwin) applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib
directories. (Maybe you have nothing like that installed now, but who
knows about things you might add in the future?)

<H3><A HREF="#TOC61" NAME="SEC61">How do anti-virus programs like
Cygwin?</A></H3>
<P>Users have reported that NAI (formerly McAfee) VirusScan for NT

to scan the newly loaded shared memory in cygwin1.dll, which can
cause fork() to fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools. (It is not
confirmed that this is still a problem, however.) 
</P>
<P>There have been several reports of NAI VirusScan causing the
system to hang when unpacking tar.gz archives. This is surely a bug
in VirusScan, and should be reported to NAI. The only workaround is
to disable VirusScan when accessing these files. This can be an issue
during setup, and is discussed in that FAQ entry. 
</P>
<P>Some users report a significant performance hit using Cygwin when
their anti-virus software is enabled. Rather than disable the
anti-virus software completely, it may be possible to specify
directories whose contents are exempt from scanning. In a default

Obviously, this could be exploited by a hostile non-Cygwin program,
so do this at your own risk.

<P>&quot;Out of queue slots!&quot; generally occurs when you're
trying to remove many files that you do not have permission to remove
(either because you don't have permission, they are opened

the supposition that it will be possible to delete these files in the
future. Assuming that the permission of an affected file does change
later on, the file will be deleted as requested. However, if too many
requests come in to delete inaccessible files, the queue overflows
and you get the message you're asking about. Usually you can remedy
this with a quick chmod, close of a file, or other such thing.

</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC74" NAME="SEC74">How is the DOS/Unix CR/LF thing
handled?</A></H3>
<P>Let's start with some background. 
</P>
<P>In UNIX, a file is a file and what the file contains is whatever
the program/programmer/user told it to put into it. In Windows, a
file is also a file and what the file contains depends not only on
the program/programmer/user but also the file processing mode. 
</P>
<P>When processing in text mode, certain values of data are treated
specially. A \n (new line) written to the file will prepend a \r
(carriage return) so that if you `printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;) you in
fact get &quot;Hello\r\n&quot;. Upon reading this combination, the \r
is removed and the number of bytes returned by the read is 1 less
than was actually read. This tends to confuse programs dependent on
ftell() and fseek(). A Ctrl-Z encountered while reading a file sets
the End Of File flags even though it truly isn't the end of file. 
</P>
<P>One of Cygwin's goals is to make it possible to easily mix
Cygwin-ported Unix programs with generic Windows programs. As a
result, Cygwin opens files in text mode as is normal under Windows.
In the accompanying tools, tools that deal with binaries (e.g.
objdump) operate in Unix binary mode and tools that deal with text
files (e.g. bash) operate in text mode. 
</P>
<P>Some people push the notion of globally setting the default
processing mode to binary via mount point options or by setting the
CYGWIN environment variable. But that creates a different problem. In
binary mode, the program receives all of the data in the file,
including a \r. Since the programs will no longer deal with these
properly for you, you would have to remove the \r from the relevant
text files, especially scripts and startup resource files. This is a
porter &quot;cop out&quot;, forcing the user to deal with the \r for
the porter. 
</P>
<P>It is rather easy for the porter to fix the source code by
supplying the appropriate file processing mode switches to the
open/fopen functions. Treat all text files as text and treat all
binary files as binary. To be specific, you can select binary mode by
adding <CODE>O_BINARY</CODE> to the second argument of an <CODE>open</CODE>
call, or <CODE>&quot;b&quot;</CODE> to second argument of an <CODE>fopen</CODE>
call. You can also call <CODE>setmode (fd, O_BINARY)</CODE>. 
</P>
<P>Note that because the open/fopen switches are defined by ANSI,
they exist under most flavors of Unix; open/fopen will just ignore
the switch since they have no meaning to UNIX.

&lt;earnie_<A HREF="mailto:boyd@yahoo.com">boyd@yahoo.com</A>&gt;. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC75" NAME="SEC75">Is the Cygwin library
multi-thread-safe?</A></H3>
<P>Yes. 
</P>
<P>There is also extensive support for 'POSIX threads', see the file
<CODE>cygwin.din</CODE> for the list of POSIX thread functions
provided. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC76" NAME="SEC76">Why is some functionality only
supported in Windows NT?</A></H3>
<P>Windows 9x: n. 32 bit extensions and a graphical shell for a 16
bit patch to an 8 bit operating system originally coded for a 4 bit
microprocessor, written by a 2 bit company that can't stand 1 bit of
competition. 
</P>
<P>But seriously, Windows 9x lacks most of the security-related calls
and has several other deficiencies with respect to its version of the
Win32 API. See the calls.texinfo document for more information as to
what is not supported in Win 9x. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC77" NAME="SEC77">How is fork() implemented?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin fork() essentially works like a non-copy on write version
of fork() (like old Unix versions used to do). Because of this it can
be a little slow. In most cases, you are better off using the spawn
family of calls if possible. 
</P>
<P>Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>Parent initializes a space in the Cygwin process table for child.
Parent creates child suspended using Win32 CreateProcess call, giving
the same path it was invoked with itself. Parent calls setjmp to save
its own context and then sets a pointer to this in the Cygwin shared
memory area (shared among all Cygwin tasks). Parent fills in the
child's .data and .bss subsections by copying from its own address
space into the suspended child's address space. Parent then starts
the child. Parent waits on mutex for child to get to safe point.
Child starts and discovers if has been forked and then longjumps
using the saved jump buffer. Child sets mutex parent is waiting on
and then blocks on another mutex waiting for parent to fill in its
stack and heap. Parent notices child is in safe area, copies stack
and heap from itself into child, releases the mutex the child is
waiting on and returns from the fork call. Child wakes from blocking
on mutex, recreates any mmapped areas passed to it via shared area
and then returns from fork itself. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC78" NAME="SEC78">How does wildcarding (globbing)
work?</A></H3>
<P>If the DLL thinks it was invoked from a DOS style prompt, it runs
a `globber' over the arguments provided on the command line. This
means that if you type <CODE>LS *.EXE</CODE> from DOS, it will do
what you might expect. 
</P>
<P>Beware: globbing uses <CODE>malloc</CODE>. If your application
defines <CODE>malloc</CODE>, that will get used. This may do horrible
things to you. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC79" NAME="SEC79">How do symbolic links work?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin knows of two ways to create symlinks. 
</P>
<P>The old method is the only valid one up to but not including
version 1.3.0. If it's enabled (from 1.3.0 on by setting
`nowinsymlinks' in the environment variable CYGWIN) Cygwin generates
link files with a magic header. When you open a file or directory
that is a link to somewhere else, it opens the file or directory
listed in the magic header. Because we don't want to have to open
every referenced file to check symlink status, Cygwin marks symlinks
with the system attribute. Files without the system attribute are not
checked. Because remote samba filesystems do not enable the system
attribute by default, symlinks do not work on network drives unless
you explicitly enable this attribute. 
</P>
<P>The new method which is introduced with Cygwin version 1.3.0 is
enabled by default or if `winsymlinks' is set in the environment
variable CYGWIN. Using this method, Cygwin generates symlinks by
creating Windows shortcuts. Cygwin created shortcuts have a special
header (which is in that way never created by Explorer) and the R/O
attribute set. A DOS path is stored in the shortcut as usual and the
description entry is used to store the POSIX path. While the POSIX
path is stored as is, the DOS path has perhaps to be rearranged to
result in a valid path. This may result in a divergence between the
DOS and the POSIX path when symlinks are moved crossing mount points.
When a user changes the shortcut, this will be detected by Cygwin and
it will only use the DOS path then. While Cygwin shortcuts are shown
without the &quot;.lnk&quot; suffix in `ls' output, non-Cygwin
shortcuts are shown with the suffix. However, both are treated as
symlinks. 
</P>
<P>Both, the old and the new symlinks can live peacefully together
since Cygwin treats both as symlinks regardless of the setting of
`(no)winsymlinks' in the environment variable CYGWIN. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC80" NAME="SEC80">Why do some files, which are not
executables have the 'x' type.</A></H3>
<P>When working out the Unix-style attribute bits on a file, the
library has to fill out some information not provided by the WIN32
API. 
</P>
<P>It guesses that files ending in .exe and .bat are executable, as
are ones which have a &quot;#!&quot; as their first characters. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC81" NAME="SEC81">How secure is Cygwin in a
multi-user environment?</A></H3>
<P>As of version 1.5.13, the Cygwin developers are not aware of any
feature in the cygwin dll that would allow users to gain privileges
or to access objects to which they have no rights under Windows.
However there is no guarantee that Cygwin is as secure as the Windows
it runs on. Cygwin processes share some variables and are thus easier
targets of denial of service type of attacks. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC82" NAME="SEC82">How do the net-related functions
work?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The network support in Cygwin is supposed to provide the Unix API,
not the Winsock API. 
</P>
<P>There are differences between the semantics of functions with the
same name under the API. 
</P>
<P>E.g., the select system call on Unix can wait on a standard file
handles and handles to sockets. The select call in Winsock can only
wait on sockets. Because of this, cygwin.dll does a lot of nasty
stuff behind the scenes, trying to persuade various Winsock/win32
functions to do what a Unix select would do. 
</P>
<P>If you are porting an application which already uses Winsock, then
using the net support in Cygwin is wrong. 
</P>
<P>But you can still use native Winsock, and use Cygwin. The
functions which cygwin.dll exports are called 'cygwin_&lt;name&gt;'.
There are a load of defines which map the standard Unix names to the
names exported by the DLL-- check out include/netdb.h: 
</P>
<PRE>..etc..
void            cygwin_setprotoent (int);
void            cygwin_setservent (int);
void            cygwin_setrpcent (int);
..etc..
#ifndef __INSIDE_CYGWIN_NET__
#define endprotoent cygwin_endprotoent 
#define endservent cygwin_endservent 
#define endrpcent  cygwin_endrpcent  
..etc..</PRE><P>
The idea is that you'll get the Unix-&gt;Cygwin mapping if you
include the standard Unix header files. If you use this, you won't
need to link with libwinsock.a - all the net stuff is inside the DLL.
</P>
<P>The mywinsock.h file is a standard winsock.h which has been hacked
to remove the bits which conflict with the standard Unix API, or are
defined in other headers. E.g., in mywinsock.h, the definition of
struct hostent is removed. This is because on a Unix box, it lives in
netdb. It isn't a good idea to use it in your applications. 
</P>
<P>As of the b19 release, this information may be slightly out of
date. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC83" NAME="SEC83">I don't want Unix sockets, how do I
use normal Win32 winsock?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>To use the vanilla Win32 winsock, you just need to #define
Win32_Winsock and #include &quot;windows.h&quot; at the top of your
source file(s). You'll also want to add -lwsock32 to the compiler's
command line so you link against libwsock32.a. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC84" NAME="SEC84">What version numbers are associated
with Cygwin?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin versioning is relatively complicated because of its status
as a shared library. First of all, since October 1998 every Cygwin
DLL has been named <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> and has a 1 in the
release name. Additionally, there are DLL major and minor numbers
that correspond to the name of the release, and a release number. In
other words, cygwin-1.5.10-2 is <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE>, major
version 5, minor version 10, release 2. 
</P>
<P>The <CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> major version number gets incremented
only when a change is made that makes existing software incompatible.
For example, the first major version 5 release, cygwin-1.5.0-1, added
64-bit file I/O operations, which required many libraries to be
recompiled and relinked. The minor version changes every time we make
a new backward compatible Cygwin release available. There is also a
<CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> release version number. The release number
is only incremented if we update an existing release in a way that
does not effect the DLL (like a missing header file). 
</P>
<P>There are also Cygwin API major and minor numbers. The major
number tracks important non-backward-compatible interface changes to
the API. An executable linked with an earlier major number will not
be compatible with the latest DLL. The minor number tracks
significant API additions or changes that will not break older
executables but may be required by newly compiled ones. 
</P>
<P>Then there is a shared memory region compatibility version number.
It is incremented when incompatible changes are made to the shared
memory region or to any named shared mutexes, semaphores, etc.
Finally there is a mount point registry version number which keeps
track of non-backwards-compatible changes to the registry mount table
layout. This has been <CODE>mounts v2</CODE> for a long time. For
more exciting Cygwin version number details, check out the
<CODE>/usr/include/cygwin/version.h</CODE> file. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC85" NAME="SEC85">Why isn't _timezone set correctly?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Did you explicitly call tzset() before checking the value of
_timezone? If not, you must do so. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC86" NAME="SEC86">Is there a mouse interface?</A></H3>
<P>There is no way to capture mouse events from Cygwin. There are
currently no plans to add support for this. 
</P>
<H2><A HREF="#TOC87" NAME="SEC87">Programming Questions</A></H2>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC88" NAME="SEC88">How do I contribute a package?</A></H3>
<P>If you are willing to be a package maintainer, great! We urgently
need volunteers to prepare and maintain packages, because the
priority of the Cygwin Team is Cygwin itself. 
</P>
<P>The Cygwin Package Contributor's Guide at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</A></STRONG>
details everything you need to know about being a package maintainer.
The quickest way to get started is to read the <EM>Initial packaging
procedure, script-based</EM> section on that page. The
<SAMP>`generic-build-script'</SAMP> found there works well for most
packages. 
</P>
<P>For questions about package maintenance, use the cygwin-apps
mailing list (start at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/lists.html">http://cygwin.com/lists.html</A></STRONG>)
<EM>after</EM> searching and browsing the cygwin-apps list archives,
of course. Be sure to look at the <EM>Submitting a package</EM>
checklist at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</A></STRONG>
before sending an ITP (Intent To Package) email to cygwin-apps. 
</P>
<P>You should also announce your intentions to the general cygwin
list, in case others were thinking the same thing. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC89" NAME="SEC89">How do I contribute to Cygwin?</A></H3>

</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC90" NAME="SEC90">Why are compiled executables so
huge?!?</A></H3>
<P>By default, gcc compiles in all symbols. You'll also find that gcc
creates large executables on UNIX. 
</P>
<P>If that bothers you, just use the 'strip' program, part of the
binutils package. Or compile with the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> option to
gcc. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC91" NAME="SEC91">Where is glibc?</A></H3>
<P>Cygwin does not provide glibc. It uses newlib instead, which
provides much (but not all) of the same functionality. Porting glibc
to Cygwin would be difficult. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC92" NAME="SEC92">Where is Objective C?</A></H3>
<P>Objective C is not distributed with the Cygwin version of gcc, and
there are no plans to do so. The gcc package maintainer had
difficulty building it, and once built there were problems using it.
It appears that there is only minimal support for the Objective C
front-end in the main GCC distribution, anyway. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC93" NAME="SEC93">Why does my make fail on Cygwin
with an execvp error?</A></H3>
<P>First of all, if you are using <SAMP>`make -j[N]'</SAMP>, then
stop. It doesn't work well. Also beware of using non-portable shell
features in your Makefiles (see tips at
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC46">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC46</A></STRONG>).
</P>
<P>Errors of <SAMP>`make: execvp: /bin/sh: Illegal Argument'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`make: execvp: /bin/sh: Argument list too long'</SAMP> are
often caused by the command-line being to long for the Windows
execution model. To circumvent this, mount the path of the executable
using the -X switch to enable cygexec for all executables in that
folder; you will also need to exclude non-cygwin executables with the
-x switch. Enabling cygexec causes cygwin executables to talk
directly to one another, which increases the command-line limit. To
enable cygexec for <SAMP>`/bin'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`/usr/bin'</SAMP>,
you can use these commands in a batch file: 
</P>
<PRE>mount -X -b -f c:\cygwin\bin /bin
mount -X -b -f c:\cygwin\bin /usr/bin
mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\strace.exe /usr/bin/strace.exe

mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\cygcheck.exe /bin/cygcheck.exe</PRE><P>
Note that you must specifically exclude <CODE>strace</CODE> and
<CODE>cygcheck</CODE>, which are not linked to the Cygwin DLL.

<A HREF="#TOC95" NAME="SEC95">How do I use Win32 API calls?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>It's pretty simple actually. Cygwin tools require that you
explicitly link the import libraries for whatever Win32 API functions
that you are going to use, with the exception of kernel32, which is
linked automatically (because the startup and/or built-in code uses
it). 
</P>
<P>For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you must link with
gdi32 like this: 
</P>
<P>gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32 
</P>
<P>or (compiling and linking in one step): 
</P>
<P>gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32 
</P>
<P>The following libraries are available for use in this way: 
</P>
<P>advapi32 largeint ole32 scrnsave vfw32 cap lz32 oleaut32 shell32
win32spl comctl32 mapi32 oledlg snmp winmm comdlg32 mfcuia32 olepro32

odbc32 rpcndr uuid imm32 odbccp32 rpcns4 vdmdbg kernel32 oldnames
rpcrt4 version 
</P>
<P>The regular setup allows you to use the option -mwindows on the
command line to include a set of the basic libraries (and also make
your program a GUI program instead of a console program), including
user32, gdi32 and, IIRC, comdlg32. 
</P>
<P>Note that you should never include -lkernel32 on your link line
unless you are invoking ld directly. Do not include the same import
library twice on your link line. Finally, it is a good idea to put
import libraries last on your link line, or at least after all the
object files and static libraries that reference them. 
</P>
<P>The first two are related to problems the linker has (as of b18 at
least) when import libraries are referenced twice. Tables get messed
up and programs crash randomly. The last point has to do with the
fact that gcc processes the files listed on the command line in
sequence and will only resolve references to libraries if they are
given after the file that makes the reference. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC96" NAME="SEC96">How do I compile a Win32 executable
that doesn't use Cygwin?</A></H3>
<P>The -mno-cygwin flag to gcc makes gcc link against standard
Microsoft DLLs instead of Cygwin. This is desirable for native
Windows programs that don't need a UNIX emulation layer. 
</P>
<P>This is not to be confused with 'MinGW' (Minimalist GNU for
Windows), which is a completely separate effort. That project's home
page is <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml">http://www.mingw.org/index.shtml</A></STRONG>.
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC97" NAME="SEC97">Can I build a Cygwin program that
does not require cygwin1.dll at runtime?</A></H3>
<P>No. If your program uses the Cygwin API, then your executable
cannot run without cygwin1.dll. In particular, it is not possible to
statically link with a Cygwin library to obtain an independent,
self-contained executable. 
</P>
<P>If this is an issue because you intend to distribute your Cygwin

<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">http://cygwin.com/licensing.html</A></STRONG>,

</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC98" NAME="SEC98">Can I link with both MSVCRT*.DLL

<P>No, you must use one or the other, they are mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC99" NAME="SEC99">How do I make the console window go
away?</A></H3>
<P>The default during compilation is to produce a console
application. It you are writing a GUI program, you should either
compile with -mwindows as explained above, or add the string
&quot;-Wl,--subsystem,windows&quot; to the GCC command line. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC100" NAME="SEC100">Why does make complain about a
&quot;missing separator&quot;?</A></H3>

</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC101" NAME="SEC101">Why can't we redistribute

<P>Before you begin, note that Cygwin is licensed under the GNU GPL
(as indeed are all other Cygwin-based libraries). That means that if
your code links against the cygwin dll (and if your program is

<P>You can use these methods to use MSVC (and many other runtime
libs) with Cygwin development tools. 
</P>
<P>Note that this is a lot of work (half a day or so), but much less
than rewriting the runtime library in question from specs... 
</P>
<P>Thanks to Jacob Navia (root at jacob dot remcomp dot fr) for this
explanation. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC104" NAME="SEC104">How do I build Cygwin on my own?</A></H3>
<P>First, you need to get the Cygwin source. Ideally, you should
check out what you need from CVS (<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cvs.html">http://cygwin.com/cvs.html</A></STRONG>).
This is the <EM>preferred method</EM> for acquiring the sources.
Otherwise, you can install the cygwin source package from the
distribution. 
</P>
<P>If you are trying to duplicate a cygwin release then you should
just download the corresponding source package and use &quot;tar xjf&quot;
to unpack it. This will unpack the sources into a directory named
cygwin-x.y.z-n, where x.y.z-n correspond to the version numbering of
the tar.bz2 package. 
</P>
<PRE>tar xjf cygwin-1.5.12-1-src.tar.bz2
cd cygwin-1.5.12-1</PRE><P>
You <EM>must</EM> build cygwin in a separate directory from the
source, so create something like a <SAMP>`build/'</SAMP> directory.
You will also want to install to a temporary location: 
</P>
<PRE>mkdir build
mkdir /install 
cd build
(../configure --prefix=/install -v; make) &gt;&amp; make.out
make install &gt; install.log 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE><P>
Normally, this procedure ignore errors in building the documentation.
which requires the <SAMP>`docbook-xml'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`docbook-xsl'</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`xmlto'</SAMP> packages. For more information on building
the documentation, see the README included in the cygwin-doc package.
</P>
<P>To check a cygwin1.dll, run &quot;make check&quot; in the
winsup/testsuite directory. If that works, install everything <EM>except</EM>
the dll (if you can). Then, close down all cygwin programs (including
bash windows, inetd, etc.), save your old dll, and copy the new dll
to the correct place. Then start up a bash window, or run a cygwin
program from the Windows command prompt, and see what happens. 
</P>
<P>If you get the error &quot;shared region is corrupted&quot; it
means that two different versions of cygwin1.dll are running on your
machine at the same time. Remove all but one. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC105" NAME="SEC105">I may have found a bug in Cygwin,
how can I debug it (the symbols in gdb look funny)?</A></H3>
<P>Debugging symbols are stripped from distibuted Cygwin binaries, so
any symbols that you see in gdb are basically meaningless. It is also
a good idea to use the latest code in case the bug has been fixed, so
we recommend trying the latest snapshot from
<STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/snapshots/">http://cygwin.com/snapshots/</A></STRONG>
or build the DLL from CVS. 
</P>
<P>To build a debugging version of the Cygwin DLL, you will need to
follow the instructions at <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC102">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC102</A></STRONG>.
You can also contact the mailing list for pointers (a simple test
case that demonstrates the bug is always welcome). 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC106" NAME="SEC106">How can I compile Cygwin for an
unsupported platform (PowerPC, Alpha, ARM, Itanium)?</A></H3>
<P>Unfortunately, this will be difficult. Exception handling and
signals support semantics and args have been designed for x86 so you
would need to write specific support for your platform. We don't know
of any other incompatibilities. Please send us patches if you do this
work!

Cygwin, see <STRONG><A HREF="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html</A></STRONG>.
Otherwise, just pass heap/stack linker arguments to gcc. To create
foo.exe with a heap size of 1024 and a stack size of 4096, you would
invoke gcc as: 
</P>
<P><CODE>gcc -Wl,--heap,1024,--stack,4096 -o foo foo.c</CODE> 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC108" NAME="SEC108">How can I find out which DLLs are

</P>
<P><SAMP>`cygcheck'</SAMP> will do this much more concisely, and
operates recursively, provided the command is in your path. 
</P>
<P>Note there is currently a bug in cygcheck in that it will not
report on a program in a Windows system dir (e.g., C:\Windows or
C:\WINNT) even if it's in your path. To work around this, supply the
full Win32 path to the executable, including the .exe extension:

and related messages.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>You must execute the following sequence of five commands, in this
order: 
</P>
<PRE>$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
        --base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) -s --base-file BASEFILE EXPFILE -dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY

$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE \
        --base-file BASEFILE --output-exp EXPFILE

$(LD) EXPFILE --dll -o DLLNAME OBJS LIBS -e ENTRY</PRE><P>
In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld. 
</P>
<P>$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool. 
</P>
<P>$(AS) is the assembler, as. 
</P>
<P>DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create, e.g.,
tcl80.dll. 
</P>
<P>OBJS is the list of object files you want to put into the DLL. 
</P>
<P>LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the DLL against.
For example, you may or may not want -lcygwin. You may want
-lkernel32. Tcl links against -lcygwin -ladvapi32 -luser32 -lgdi32
-lcomdlg32 -lkernel32. 
</P>
<P>DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file. A simple DEFFILE
would consist of &quot;EXPORTS&quot; followed by a list of all
symbols which should be exported from the DLL. Each symbol should be
on a line by itself. Other programs will only be able to access the
listed symbols. 
</P>
<P>BASEFILE is a temporary file that is used during this five stage
process, e.g., tcl.base. 
</P>
<P>EXPFILE is another temporary file, e.g., tcl.exp. 
</P>
<P>ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to use as the
entry point. This function should be defined using the WINAPI
attribute, and should take three arguments: int WINAPI startup
(HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID) 
</P>
<P>This means that the actual symbol name will have an appended <A HREF="mailto:@12">@12</A>,
so if your entry point really is named <SAMP>`startup'</SAMP>, the
string you should use for ENTRY in the above examples would be
<SAMP>`<A HREF="mailto:startup@12">startup@12</A>'</SAMP>. 
</P>
<P>If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the entry function
will need to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer. You can do that by
declaring a global variable <SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP>, and then
initializing it in the entry function. Be careful not to export the
global variable <SAMP>`_impure_ptr'</SAMP> from your DLL; that is, do
not put it in DEFFILE. 
</P>
<PRE>/* This is a global variable.  */
struct _reent *_impure_ptr;
extern struct _reent *__imp_reent_data;

int entry (HINSTANT hinst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)
{
  _impure_ptr = __imp_reent_data;
  /* Whatever else you want to do.  */
}</PRE><P>
You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines. The
Tcl build does this, but I admit that I no longer remember whether
this is important. Note that if you specify a --subsytem &lt;x&gt;
flag to ld, the -e entry must come after the subsystem flag, since
the subsystem flag sets a different default entry point. 
</P>
<P>You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on the $(LD)
lines. This will set the default image base. Programs using this DLL
will start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a different portion
of the address space. Each DLL starts at the image base, and
continues for whatever size it occupies. 
</P>
<P>Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to build a library so
that other programs can link against it. This is not required: you
could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary. However, if you want to be
able to link directly against the DLL, you need to create a library.
Do that like this: 
</P>
<P>$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE --output-lib
LIBFILE 
</P>
<P>$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same as above.
Make sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or things won't work
right. 
</P>
<P>LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to create, e.g.,
libtcl80.a. You can then link against that library using something
like -ltcl80 in your linker command. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC112" NAME="SEC112">How can I debug what's going on?</A></H3>
<P>You can debug your application using <CODE>gdb</CODE>. Make sure
you compile it with the -g flag! If your application calls functions
in MS DLLs, gdb will complain about not being able to load debug
information for them when you run your program. This is normal since
these DLLs don't contain debugging information (and even if they did,
that debug info would not be compatible with gdb). 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC113" NAME="SEC113">Can I use a system trace
mechanism instead?</A></H3>
<P>Yes. You can use the <CODE>strace.exe</CODE> utility to run other
cygwin programs with various debug and trace messages enabled. For
information on using <CODE>strace</CODE>, see the Cygwin User's Guide
or the file <CODE>winsup/utils/utils.sgml</CODE>. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC114" NAME="SEC114">Why doesn't gdb handle signals?</A></H3>
<P>Unfortunately, there is only minimal signal handling support in
gdb currently. Signal handling only works with Windows-type signals.
SIGINT may work, SIGFPE may work, SIGSEGV definitely does. You cannot
'stop', 'print' or 'nopass' signals like SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP to the
process being debugged. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC115" NAME="SEC115">The linker complains that it
can't find something.</A></H3>
<P>A common error is to put the library on the command line before
the thing that needs things from it. 
</P>
<P>This is wrong <CODE>gcc -lstdc++ hello.cc</CODE>. This is right
<CODE>gcc hello.cc -lstdc++</CODE>. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC116" NAME="SEC116">I use a function I know is in the
API, but I still get a link error.</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The function probably isn't declared in the header files, or the
UNICODE stuff for it isn't filled in.

<H3><A HREF="#TOC117" NAME="SEC117">Can you make DLLs that are linked
against libc ?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for

</P>
<P>Yes. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC118" NAME="SEC118">Where is malloc.h?</A></H3>
<P><STRONG>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for
the latest net release.)</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Include stdlib.h instead of malloc.h. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC119" NAME="SEC119">Can I use my own malloc?</A></H3>
<P>If you define a function called <CODE>malloc</CODE> in your own
code, and link with the DLL, the DLL <EM>will</EM> call your <CODE>malloc</CODE>.
Needless to say, you will run into serious problems if your malloc is
buggy. 
</P>
<P>If you run any programs from the DOS command prompt, rather than
from in bash, the DLL will try and expand the wildcards on the
command line. This process uses <CODE>malloc</CODE> <EM>before</EM>
your main line is started. If you have written your own <CODE>malloc</CODE>
to need some initialization to occur after <CODE>main</CODE> is
called, then this will surely break. 
</P>
<P>Moreover, there is an outstanding issue with <CODE>_malloc_r</CODE>
in <CODE>newlib</CODE>. This re-entrant version of <CODE>malloc</CODE>
will be called directly from within <CODE>newlib</CODE>, by-passing
your custom version, and is probably incompatible with it. But it may
not be possible to replace <CODE>_malloc_r</CODE> too, because
<CODE>cygwin1.dll</CODE> does not export it and Cygwin does not
expect your program to replace it. This is really a newlib issue, but
we are open to suggestions on how to deal with it. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC120" NAME="SEC120">Can I mix objects compiled with
msvc++ and gcc?</A></H3>
<P>Yes, but only if you are combining C object files. MSVC C++ uses a
different mangling scheme than GNU C++, so you will have difficulties
combining C++ objects. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC121" NAME="SEC121">Can I use the gdb debugger to
debug programs built by VC++?</A></H3>
<P>No, not for full (high level source language) debugging. The
Microsoft compilers generate a different type of debugging symbol
information, which gdb does not understand. 
</P>
<P>However, the low-level (assembly-type) symbols generated by
Microsoft compilers are coff, which gdb DOES understand. Therefore
you should at least be able to see all of your global symbols; you
just won't have any information about data types, line numbers, local
variables etc. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC122" NAME="SEC122">Where can I find info on x86

</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC123" NAME="SEC123">Shell scripts aren't running
properly from my makefiles?</A></H3>
<P>If your scripts are in the current directory, you must have <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>

Otherwise, you would need to add /bin/sh in front of each and every
shell script invoked in your Makefiles. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC124" NAME="SEC124">What preprocessor do I need to
know about?</A></H3>
<P>We use _WIN32 to signify access to the Win32 API and __CYGWIN__
for access to the Cygwin environment provided by the dll. 
</P>
<P>We chose _WIN32 because this is what Microsoft defines in VC++ and
we thought it would be a good idea for compatibility with VC++ code
to follow their example. We use _MFC_VER to indicate code that should
be compiled with VC++. 
</P>
<P>_WIN32 is only defined when you use either the -mno-cygwin or
-mwin32 gcc command line options. This is because Cygwin is supposed
to be a Unix emulation environment and defining _WIN32 confuses some
programs which think that they have to make special concessions for a
Windows environment which Cygwin handles automatically. 
</P>
<P>Note that using -mno-cygwin replaces __CYGWIN__ with __MINGW32__
as to tell which compiler (or settings) you're running. Check this
out in detail by running, for example 
</P>
<PRE>       $ gcc  -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc.txt
       $ gcc -mno-cygwin -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc-mno-cygwin.txt
       $ gcc -mwin32 -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc-mwin32.txt</PRE><P>
Then use the diff and grep utilities to check what the difference is.
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC125" NAME="SEC125">How should I port my Unix GUI to
Windows?</A></H3>
<P>There are two basic strategies for porting Unix GUIs to Windows. 
</P>
<P>The first is to use a portable graphics library such as tcl/tk,
X11, or V (and others?). Typically, you will end up with a GUI on
Windows that requires some runtime support. With tcl/tk, you'll want
to include the necessary library files and the tcl/tk DLLs. In the
case of X11, you'll need everyone using your program to have an X11
server installed. 
</P>
<P>The second method is to rewrite your GUI using Win32 API calls (or
MFC with VC++). If your program is written in a fairly modular
fashion, you may still want to use Cygwin if your program contains a
lot of shared (non-GUI-related) code. That way you still gain some of
the portability advantages inherent in using Cygwin. 
</P>
<H3><A HREF="#TOC126" NAME="SEC126">Why not use DJGPP ?</A></H3>
<P>DJGPP is a similar idea, but for DOS instead of Win32. DJGPP uses
a &quot;DOS extender&quot; to provide a more reasonable operating
interface for its applications. The Cygwin toolset doesn't have to do
this since all of the applications are native WIN32. Applications
compiled with the Cygwin tools can access the Win32 API functions, so
you can write programs which use the Windows GUI.

you give out any binaries, you must also make the source available.
For the full details, be sure to read the text of the GNU GPL which
follows. 
</P>
<P>The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the
source code is also covered by the GNU GPL. By default, all
executables link against this library (and in the process include
GPL'd Cygwin glue code). This means that unless you modify the tools
so that compiled executables do not make use of the Cygwin library,
your compiled programs will also have to be free software distributed
under the GPL with source code available to all. 
</P>
<P>Cygwin is currently available for proprietary use only through a
proprietary-use license. Please see
<STRONG><A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/">http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/</A></STRONG>
for more information about the Red Hat Cygwin Product. 
</P>
<P>In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat, Inc. permits
programs whose sources are distributed under a license that complies
with the Open Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without
libcygwin.a itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the
GNU GPL. 
</P>
<P>This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to
cygwin, and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy
of libcygwin.a linked into it. Note that this does not apply to the
cygwin DLL itself. If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of
the DLL you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e., you must
provide sources for the cygwin DLL.

                      Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.</PRE>
