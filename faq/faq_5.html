<H1><A NAME="SEC125" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC125">Known Problems in the Latest Net Release</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC126" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC126">Aware of the problem, no solution known.</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC127" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC127">Pipe key (<SAMP>`|'</SAMP>) doesn't work on non-US keyboards in Win9x/ME</A></H3>

<P>
This might get fixed someday, but meanwhile, just use rxvt, which does
not have this problem.  This is no real loss, because rxvt has many
other advantages.  (Do not attempt to use the "broken" pipe key
(<SAMP>`¦'</SAMP>) as a substitute, it is a different character.)




<H3><A NAME="SEC128" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC128">Cannot access tape devices with mt on Win9x</A></H3>

<P>
Win9x does not support the API used by the Cygwin fhandler_dev_tape
class.  Details at
<TT><a target="_top" href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2000-12/msg00331.html">http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2000-12/msg00331.html</a></TT>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC129" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC129">Hang or core-dump during make</A></H3>

<P>
There is a rare core-dump that seems to be triggered by a recursive
make.  There is also a hang condition that happens more frequently
during parallel makes (<CODE>make -j 3</CODE>).  The solution is not known,
so please help debug this.  "Me too" reports are not useful, unless
accompanied by exhaustive, useful data (stack traces, reproducible
test cases, patches).




<H2><A NAME="SEC130" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC130">Fixed in the Next Release</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="faq_toc.html#TOC131">On Win9x, scp and cvs/ssh leave ssh processes running, and cvs/ssh hangs at completion</A></H3>
