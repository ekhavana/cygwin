<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<p>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat, Inc.)
and the project is still run by two employees from Red Hat, even though
there is very little further ongoing Cygwin development within Red Hat.

<p>Chris Faylor is the current project lead and has led the project
through all of its recent innovations as well as acting as the primary
developer responsible for pathname and signal handling in the Cygwin
DLL.  Although he works at Red Hat, most of his Cygwin activities occur
on his own time.</p>

<p>Corinna Vinschen is the other senior Red Hat engineer who provides
substantial Cygwin support, also in her spare time.  Corinna is responsible
for such important subsystems as security and networking.</p>

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sources.redhat.com, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Egor Duda, Chuck
Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason Tishler, Robert
Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin, Chris January,
Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, and Pierre Humblet.

<p>The Engineering Services branch of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">
Red Hat, Inc.</a> is a leader in Open Source-based software development
tools, mission critical support, and custom engineering for the embedded
systems market.  Cygwin is offered commercially as one of the offerings
in <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/gnupro/">the GNUPro
Toolkit</a>; development tools for 125 desktop and cross-platform
development environments.
