<h1>Who are we?*</h1>
<ul>
<li>Christopher Faylor (cgf) is one of the project leads.  Chris works
for Netapp but all of his Cygwin activities occur on his own time.  He
is most notably responsible for the support of signal handling and
fork/exec in Cygwin.  He also administers the <a href="http://sourceware.org/">
system</a> which hosts the <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin project</a>.

<br><br><li>Corinna Vinschen (corinna) is the other project lead.
Corinna is a senior <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> engineer.
Corinna is responsible for such important subsystems as security,
networking, and internationalization.

<br><br><li>Yaakov Selkowitz maintains a large number of Cygwin packages as well
as providing packages via Cygwin's <a href="http://cygwinports.org/">Cygwin Ports</a> sister site.
Yaakov is also a <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a>
lead.

<br><br><li>Jon Turney is a project lead for <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a>
and is responsible for improvements to the X server.

<br><br><li>The <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">Cygwin setup</a> project
is currently maintained by various package maintainers.  Jon Turney has
recently contributed many stability improvements.

<br><br><li>Eric Blake (eblake) maintains bash, coreutils, and several other
vitally important packags.

<br><br><li>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat,
Inc.) but the majority of package maintainership and a significant
percentage of Cygwin development is handled by non-Red Hat
volunteers.

<br><br><li>Like many <a href="http://sourceware.org/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sourceware.org, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Sergey Okhapkin,
Egor Duda, Chuck Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason
Tishler, Robert Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin,
Chris January, Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, Pierre Humblet, Igor
Peshansky, Brian Dessent, Brian Ford, Jari Aalto, Ken Brown, and Marco Atzeri.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>* Please note that all of the people above prefer that project related
communications go to the proper mailing list rather than private email.</p>
