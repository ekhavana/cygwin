<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>Cygwin is a full-featured Win32 porting layer for UNIX
applications, compatible with all Win32 hosts (currently Microsoft
Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98).  It was invented in 1995 by
Cygnus Solutions as part of the answer to the question of how to port
the GNU development tools to the Win32 host.</P>

<P>The Win32-hosted GNUPro compiler tools that use the library are
available for a variety of embedded processors as well as a native
version for writing Win32 programs.  By basing this technology on the
GNU tools, Cygnus provides developers with a high-performance,
feature-rich 32-bit code development environment, including a
graphical source-level debugger.</P>

<P>Cygwin is a Dynamic-Linked Library (DLL) that provides a large
subset of the system calls found in common UNIX implementations.  The
current release includes all POSIX.1/90 calls except for setuid and
mkfifo, all ANSI C standard calls, and many common BSD and SVR4
services including Berkeley sockets.</P><P>This article will discuss
our experiences porting the GNU development tools to the Win32 host
and explore the development and architecture of the Cygwin
library.</P>

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>Cygnus Solutions was founded in 1989 to provide commercial support
and development services for the GNU development tools, focusing on
the embedded computing industry.  The tools include the GNU C/C++
compiler (GCC/G++), assembler (GAS), linker (GLD), and debugger (GDB).
As of June 1998, Cygnus sells support for over 150 host/target
combinations.</P>

<P>When the Free Software Foundation (FSF) first wrote the GNU tools
in the mid-1980s, portability among existing and future UNIX operating
systems was an important goal.  By mid-1995, the tools had been ported
to 16-bit DOS using the go32 32-bit extender by DJ Delorie<SUP><A
HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>.  However, no one had completed a native 32-bit
port for Windows NT and 95/98.  It seemed likely that the demand for
Win32-hosted native and cross-development tools would soon be large
enough to justify the development costs involved.</P>

<H2>2. Porting the GNU Compiler to Win32</H2>

<P>The first step in porting the compiler tools to Win32 was to
enhance them so that they could generate and interpret Win32 native
object files, using Microsoft's Portable Executable (PE) format.  This
proved to be relatively straightforward because of similarities to the
Common Object File Format (COFF), which the GNU tools already
supported.  Most of these changes were confined to the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library and to the linker.</P>

<P>In order to support the Win32 Application Programming Interface
(API), we extended the capabilities of the binary utilities to handle
Dynamic-Linked Libraries (DLLs).  After creating export lists for the
specific Win32 API DLLs that are shipped with Win32 hosts, the tools
were able to generate static libraries that executables could use to
gain access to Win32 API functions.  Because of redistribution
restrictions on Microsoft's Win32 API header files, we wrote our own
Win32 header files from scratch on an as-needed basis.  Once this work
was completed, we were able to build UNIX-hosted cross-compilers
capable of generating valid PE executables that ran on Win32
systems.</P>

<P>The next task was to port the compiler tools themselves
to Win32.  Previous experiences using Microsoft Visual C++ to port GDB
convinced us to find another means for bootstrapping the full set of
tools.  In addition to wanting to use our own compiler technology, we
wanted a portable build system.  The GNU development tools'
configuration and build procedures require a large number of
additional UNIX utilities not available on Win32 hosts.  So we decided
to use UNIX-hosted cross-compilers to build our Win32-hosted native
and cross-development tools.  It made perfect sense to do this since
we were successfully using a nearly identical technique to build our
DOS-hosted products.</P>

<P>The next obstacle to overcome was the many dependencies on UNIX
system calls in the sources, especially in the GNU debugger GDB.
While we could have rewritten sizable portions of the source code to
work within the context of the Win32 API (as was done for the
DOS-hosted tools), this would have been prohibitively time-consuming.
Worse, we would have introduced conditionalized code that would have
been expensive to maintain in the long run.  Instead, Cygnus
developers took a substantially different approach by writing
Cygwin.</P>

<H2>3. Initial Goals</H2>

<P>The original goal of Cygwin was simply to get the development
tools working.  Completeness with respect to POSIX.1<SUP><A
HREF="#2">2</A></SUP> and other relevant UNIX standards was not a
priority.</P>

<P>Part of our definition of "working native tools" is having a build
environment similar enough to UNIX to support rebuilding the tools
themselves on the host system, a process we call self-hosting.  The
typical configuration procedure for a GNU tool involves running
"configure", a complex Bourne shell script that determines information
about the host system. The script then uses that information to
generate the Makefiles used to build the tool on the host in
question.</P>

<P>This configuration mechanism is needed under UNIX because of the large
number of varying flavors of UNIX.  If Microsoft continues to produce
new variants of the Win32 API as it releases new versions of its
operating systems, it may prove to be quite valuable on the Win32 host
as well.</P>

<P>The need to support this configuration procedure added the
requirement of supporting user tools such as sh, make, file utilities
(e.g. ls and rm), text utilities (e.g. cat, tr), shell utilities
(e.g. echo, date, uname), sed, awk, find, xargs, tar, and gzip, among
many others.  Previously, most of these user tools had only been built
natively (on the host on which they would run).  As a result, we had
to modify their configure scripts to be compatible with
cross-compilation.</P>

<P>Other than making the necessary configuration changes, we wanted to
avoid Win32-specific changes since the UNIX compatibility was to be
provided by Cygwin as much as possible.  While we knew this would be
a sizable amount of work, there was more to gain than just achieving
self-hosting of the tools.  Supporting the configuration of the
development tools would also provide an excellent method of testing
the Cygwin library.</P>

<P>Although we were able to build working
Win32-hosted toolchains with cross-compilers relatively soon after the
birth of Cygwin, it took much longer than we expected before the
tools could reliably rebuild themselves on the Win32 host because of
the many complexities involved.</P>

<H2>4. "Harnessing the Power of the Internet"</H2>

<P>Instead of keeping the Cygwin technology
proprietary and developing it in-house, Cygnus chose to make it
publicly available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL), the traditional license for the GNU tools.  Since its
inception, we have made a new "Cygwin beta release" available via
ftp over the Internet every three or four months.  Each release
includes binaries of Cygwin and the development tools, coupled with
the source code needed to build them.  Unlike standard Cygnus
products, these free releases come without any assurances of quality
or support, although we provide a mailing list that is used for
discussion and feedback. </P>

<P>In retrospect, making the technology
freely available was a good decision because of the high demand for
quality 32-bit native tools in the Win32 arena, as well as significant
additional interest in a UNIX portability layer like Cygwin.  While
far from perfect, the beta releases are good enough for many people.
They provide us with tens of thousands of interested developers who
are willing to use and test the tools.  A few of them are even willing
to contribute code fixes and new functionality to the library.  As of
the last public release, developers on the Net had written or improved
a significant portion of the library, including important aspects such
as support for UNIX signals and the TTY/PTY calls.</P>

<P>In order to
spur as much Net participation as possible, the Cygwin project
features an open development model.  We make daily source snapshots
of the Cygwin library available to the general public in addition to
the periodic full Cygwin tools releases.  A developers' mailing list
facilitates discussion of proposed changes to the library.</P>

<P>In addition to the GPL
version of Cygwin, Cygnus provides a commercial license for
supported customers of the native Win32 GNUPro tools.</P>

<H2>5. The Cygwin Architecture</H2>

<P>Now we turn to an analysis of the actual
architecture of the Cygwin library.</P>

<P>When a binary linked
against the library is executed, the Cygwin DLL is loaded into the
application's text segment.  Because we are trying to emulate a UNIX
kernel which needs access to all processes running under it, the first
Cygwin DLL to run creates shared memory areas that other processes
using separate instances of the DLL can access.  This is used to keep
track of open file descriptors and assist fork and exec, among other
purposes.  In addition to the shared memory regions, every process
also has a per_process structure that contains information such as
process id, user id, signal masks, and other similar process-specific
information.</P>

<P>The DLL is implemented using the Win32 API, which
allows it to run on all Win32 hosts.  Because processes run under the
standard Win32 subsystem, they can access both the UNIX compatibility
calls provided by Cygwin as well as any of the Win32 API calls.
This gives the programmer complete flexibility in designing the
structure of their program in terms of the APIs used.  For example,
they could write a Win32-specific GUI using Win32 API calls on top of
a UNIX back-end that uses Cygwin.</P>

<P>Early on in the development
process, we made the important design decision that it would not be
necessary to strictly adhere to existing UNIX standards like POSIX.1
if it was not possible or if it would significantly diminish the
usability of the tools on the Win32 platform.  In many cases, an
environment variable can be set to override the default behavior and
force standards compliance.</P>

<H3>5.1. Windows NT != Windows 95/98</H3>
<P>While Windows 95 and Windows 98 are similar enough to
each other that we can safely ignore the distinction when implementing
Cygwin, Windows NT is an extremely different operating system.  For
this reason, whenever the DLL is loaded, the library checks which
operating system is active so that it can act accordingly.</P><P>In
some cases, the Win32 API is only different for historical reasons.
In this situation, the same basic functionality is available under
95/98 and NT but the method used to gain this functionality differs.
A trivial example: in our implementation of uname, the library
examines the sysinfo.dwProcessorType structure member to figure out
the processor type under 95/98.  This field is not supported in NT,
which has its own operating system-specific structure member called
sysinfo.wProcessorLevel.</P>

<P>Other differences between NT and 95/98
are much more fundamental in nature.  The best example is that only NT
provides a security model.</P>

<H3>5.2. Permissions and Security</H3>

<P>Windows NT includes a sophisticated security model
based on Access Control Lists (ACLs).  Although some modern UNIX
operating systems include support for ACLs, Cygwin maps Win32 file
ownership and permissions to the more standard, older UNIX model.  The
chmod call maps UNIX-style permissions back to the Win32 equivalents.
Because many programs expect to be able to find the /etc/passwd and
/etc/group files, we provide utilities that can be used to construct
them from the user and group information provided by the operating
system.</P>

<P>Under Windows NT, the administrator is permitted to
chown files.  There is currently no mechanism to support the setuid
concept or API call.  Although we hope to support this functionality
at some point in the future, in practice, the programs we have ported
have not needed it.</P>

<P>Under Windows 95/98, the situation is
considerably different.  Since a security model is not provided,
Cygwin fakes file ownership by making all files look like they are
owned by a default user and group id.  As under NT, file permissions
can still be determined by examining their read/write/execute status.
Rather than return an unimplemented error, under Windows 95/98, the
chown call succeeds immediately without actually performing any action
whatsoever.  This is appropriate since essentially all users jointly
own the files when no concept of file ownership exists.</P>

<P>It is
important that we discuss the implications of our "kernel" using
shared memory areas to store information about Cygwin processes.
Because these areas are not yet protected in any way, in principle a
malicious user could modify them to cause unexpected behavior in
Cygwin processes.  While this is not a new problem under Windows
95/98 (because of the lack of operating system security), it does
constitute a security hole under Windows NT.  This is because one user
could affect the Cygwin programs run by another user by changing the
shared memory information in ways that they could not in a more
typical WinNT program.  For this reason, it is not appropriate to use
Cygwin in high-security applications.  In practice, this will not be
a major problem for most uses of the
library.</P>

<H3>5.3. Files</H3>

<P>Cygwin supports both Win32- and
POSIX-style paths, using either forward or back slashes as the
directory delimiter.  Paths coming into the DLL are translated from
Win32 to POSIX as needed.  As a result, the library believes that the
file system is a POSIX-compliant one, translating paths back to Win32
paths whenever it calls a Win32 API function.  UNC pathnames (starting
with two slashes) are supported.</P>

<P>The layout of this POSIX view
of the Windows file system space is stored in the Windows registry.
While the slash ('/') directory points to the system partition by
default, this is easy to change with the Cygwin mount utility.  In
addition to selecting the slash partition, it allows mounting
arbitrary Win32 paths into the POSIX file system space.  Many people
use the utility to mount each drive letter under the slash partition
(e.g. C:\ to /c, D:\ to /d, etc...).</P>

<P>The library exports several
Cygwin-specific functions that can be used by external programs to
convert a path or path list from Win32 to POSIX or vice versa.  Shell
scripts and Makefiles cannot call these functions directly.  Instead,
they can do the same path translations by executing the "cygpath"
utility program that we provide with Cygwin.</P>

<P>Win32 file
systems are case preserving but case insensitive.  Cygwin does not
currently support case distinction because, in practice, few UNIX
programs actually rely on it.  While we could mangle file names to
support case distinction, this would add unnecessary overhead to the
library and make it more difficult for non-Cygwin applications to
access those files.</P>

<P>Symbolic links are emulated by files
containing a magic cookie followed by the path to which the link
points.  They are marked with the System attribute so that only files
with that attribute have to be read to determine whether or not the
file is a symbolic link.  Hard links are fully supported under Windows
NT on NTFS file systems.  On a FAT file system, the call falls back to
simply copying the file, a strategy that works in many
cases.</P>

<P>The inode number for a file is calculated by hashing its
full Win32 path.  The inode number generated by the stat call always
matches the one returned in d_ino of the dirent structure.  It is
worth noting that the number produced by this method is not guaranteed
to be unique.  However, we have not found this to be a significant
problem because of the low probability of generating a duplicate inode
number.</P>

<H3>5.4. Text Mode vs. Binary Mode</H3>

<P>Interoperability
with other Win32 programs such as text editors was critical to the
success of the port of the development tools.  Most Cygnus customers
upgrading from the older DOS-hosted toolchains expected the new
Win32-hosted ones to continue to work with their old development
sources.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, UNIX and Win32 use different end-of-line
terminators in text files.  Consequently, carriage-return newlines
have to be translated on the fly by Cygwin into a single newline
when reading in text mode.  The control-z character is interpreted as
a valid end-of-file character for a similar reason.</P>

<P>This
solution addresses the compatibility requirement at the expense of
violating the POSIX standard that states that text and binary mode
will be identical. Consequently, processes that attempt to lseek
through text files can no longer rely on the number of bytes read as
an accurate indicator of position in the file.  For this reason, an
environment variable can be set to override this
behavior.</P>

<H3>5.5. ANSI C Library</H3>

<P>We chose to include
Cygnus' own existing ANSI C<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> library
"newlib" as part of the library, rather than write all of the lib C
and math calls from scratch.  Newlib is a BSD-derived ANSI C library,
previously only used by cross-compilers for embedded systems
development.</P>

<P>The reuse of existing free implementations of such things
as the glob, regexp, and getopt libraries saved us considerable
effort.  In addition, Cygwin uses Doug Lea's free malloc
implementation that successfully balances speed and compactness.  The
library accesses the malloc calls via an exported function pointer.
This makes it possible for a Cygwin process to provide its own
malloc if it so desires.</P>

<H3>5.6. Process Creation</H3>

<P>The fork call in Cygwin is particularly interesting because it
does not map well on top of the Win32 API.  This makes it very
difficult to implement correctly.  Currently, the Cygwin fork is a
non-copy-on-write implementation similar to what was present in early
flavors of UNIX.</P>

<P>The first thing that happens when a parent process
forks a child process is that the parent initializes a space in the
Cygwin process table for the child.  It then creates a suspended
child process using the Win32 CreateProcess call.  Next, the parent
process calls setjmp to save its own context and sets a pointer to
this in a Cygwin shared memory area (shared among all Cygwin
tasks).  It then fills in the child's .data and .bss sections by
copying from its own address space into the suspended child's address
space.  After the child's address space is initialized, the child is
run while the parent waits on a mutex.  The child discovers it has
been forked and longjumps using the saved jump buffer.  The child then
sets the mutex the parent is waiting on and blocks on another mutex.
This is the signal for the parent to copy its stack and heap into the
child, after which it releases the mutex the child is waiting on and
returns from the fork call.  Finally, the child wakes from blocking on
the last mutex, recreates any memory-mapped areas passed to it via the
shared area, and returns from fork itself.</P>

<P>While we have some
ideas as to how to speed up our fork implementation by reducing the
number of context switches between the parent and child process, fork
will almost certainly always be inefficient under Win32.  Fortunately,
in most circumstances the spawn family of calls provided by Cygwin
can be substituted for a fork/exec pair with only a little effort.
These calls map cleanly on top of the Win32 API.  As a result, they
are much more efficient.  Changing the compiler's driver program to
call spawn instead of fork was a trivial change and increased
compilation speeds by twenty to thirty percent in our
tests.</P>

<P>However, spawn and exec present their own set of
difficulties.  Because there is no way to do an actual exec under
Win32, Cygwin has to invent its own Process IDs (PIDs).  As a
result, when a process performs multiple exec calls, there will be
multiple Windows PIDs associated with a single Cygwin PID.  In some
cases, stubs of each of these Win32 processes may linger, waiting for
their exec'd Cygwin process to exit.</P>

<H3>5.7. Signals</H3>

<P>When
a Cygwin process starts, the library starts a secondary thread for
use in signal handling.  This thread waits for Windows events used to
pass signals to the process.  When a process notices it has a signal,
it scans its signal bitmask and handles the signal in the appropriate
fashion.</P>

<P>Several complications in the implementation arise from the
fact that the signal handler operates in the same address space as the
executing program.  The immediate consequence is that Cygwin system
functions are interruptible unless special care is taken to avoid
this.   We go to some lengths to prevent the sig_send function that
sends signals from being interrupted.  In the case of a process
sending a signal to another process, we place a mutex around sig_send
such that sig_send will not be interrupted until it has completely
finished sending the signal.</P>

<P>In the case of a process sending
itself a signal, we use a separate semaphore/event pair instead of the
mutex.  sig_send starts by resetting the event and incrementing the
semaphore that flags the signal handler to process the signal.  After
the signal is processed, the signal handler signals the event that it
is done.  This process keeps intraprocess signals synchronous, as
required by POSIX.</P>

<P>Most standard UNIX signals are provided.  Job
control works as expected in shells that support
it.</P>

<H3>5.8. Sockets</H3>

<P>Socket-related calls in Cygwin simply
call the functions by the same name in Winsock, Microsoft's
implementation of Berkeley sockets.  Only a few changes were needed to
match the expected UNIX semantics - one of the most troublesome
differences was that Winsock must be initialized before the first
socket function is called.  As a result, Cygwin has to perform this
initialization when appropriate.  In order to support sockets across
fork calls, child processes initialize Winsock if any inherited file
descriptor is a socket.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, implicitly loading DLLs
at process startup is usually a slow affair.  Because many processes
do not use sockets, Cygwin explicitly loads the Winsock DLL the
first time it calls the Winsock initialization routine.  This single
change sped up GNU configure times by thirty
percent.</P>

<H3>5.9. Select</H3>

<P>The UNIX select function is another
call that does not map cleanly on top of the Win32 API.  Much to our
dismay, we discovered that the Win32 select in Winsock only worked on
socket handles.  Our implementation allows select to function normally
when given different types of file descriptors (sockets, pipes,
handles, and a custom /dev/windows windows messages
pseudo-device).</P>

<P>Upon entry into the select function, the first
operation is to sort the file descriptors into the different types.
There are then two cases to consider.  The simple case is when at
least one file descriptor is a type that is always known to be ready
(such as a disk file).  In that case, select returns immediately as
soon as it has polled each of the other types to see if they are
ready.  The more complex case involves waiting for socket or pipe file
descriptors to be ready.  This is accomplished by the main thread
suspending itself, after starting one thread for each type of file
descriptor present.  Each thread polls the file descriptors of its
respective type with the appropriate Win32 API call.  As soon as a
thread identifies a ready descriptor, that thread signals the main
thread to wake up.  This case is now the same as the first one since
we know at least one descriptor is ready.  So select returns, after
polling all of the file descriptors one last
time.</P>

<H2>6. Performance</H2>

<P>Early on in the development
process, correctness was almost the entire emphasis.  As Cygwin
became more complete, performance became a much important issue.  We
knew that the tools ran much more slowly under Win32 than under Linux
on the same machine, but it was not clear at all whether to attribute
this to differences in the operating systems or to inefficiencies in
Cygwin.</P>

<P>The lack of a working profiler has made analyzing Cygwin's
performance particularly difficult.  Although the latest version of
the library includes "real" itimer support, we have not yet found a
way to implement virtual itimers.  This is the most reliable way of
obtaining profiling data since concurrently running processes aren't
likely to skew the results.  We will soon have a combination of the
gcc compiler and the GNU profile analysis tool gprof working with
"real" itimer support which will help a great deal in optimizing
Cygwin.</P>

<P>Even without a profiler, we knew of several areas
inside Cygwin that definitely needed a fresh approach. While we
rewrote those sections of code, we used the speed of configuring the
tools under Win32 as the primary performance measurement.  This choice
made sense because we knew process creation speed was especially poor,
something that the GNU configure process stresses.</P>

<P>These performance
adjustments made it possible to completely configure the development
tools under NT with Cygwin in only ten minutes and complete the
build in just under an hour on a dual Pentium Pro 200 system with 128
MB of RAM.  This is reasonably competitive with the time taken to
complete this task under a typical flavor of the UNIX operating system
running on an identical machine.</P>

<H2>7. Ported Software</H2>

<P>In addition to being able to configure and build most GNU software,
several other significant packages have been successfully ported to
the Win32 host using the Cygwin library.  Following is a list of
some of the more interesting ones (most are not included in the free
Internet distributions):</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>X11R6 client libraries, enabling porting many X programs to the
existing free Win32 X servers.  Examples of successfully ported X
applications include xterm, ghostview, xfig, and xconq.
<LI>xemacs and vim editors.
<LI>GNU inetutils.  It is possible to run the inetd daemon as a
Windows NT service to enable UNIX-style networking, using a custom NT
login binary to allow remote logins with full user authentication.
One can achieve similar results under Windows 95/98 by running inetd
out of the autoexec.bat file, providing a custom 95/98-tailored login
binary.
<LI>KerbNet, Cygnus' implementation of the kerberos security
system.
<LI>CVS (Concurrent Versions System), a popular version
control program based on RCS.  Cygnus uses a kerberos-enabled version
of CVS to grant secure access to our source code to local and remote
engineers.
<LI>ncurses, a library that can be used to build a functioning version
of the pager "less".
<LI>ssh (secure shell) client and server.
<LI>PERL 5 scripting language.
<LI>The bash, tcsh, ash, and zsh shells.  Full job control is
available in shells that support it.
<LI>Apache web server (some source-level changes were necessary).
<LI>TCL/TK 8; also tix, itcl, and expect.  (TCL/TK needed non-trivial
configuration changes).
</UL>

<P>Typically, the only necessary source code
modification involves specifying binary mode to open calls as
appropriate.  Because our Win32 compiler always generates executables
that end in the standard .exe suffix, it is also often necessary to
make minor modifications to makefiles so that make will expect the
newly built executables to end with the suffix.</P>

<H2>8. Future Work</H2>

<P>Standards conformance is becoming a more important focus.
In the last release, all POSIX.1/90 calls are implemented except for
mkfifo and setuid. X/Open Release 4<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP>
conformance may be a desirable goal, but we have not pursued this yet.
While the current version of the library passes most of the NIST POSIX
test suite<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> with flying colors, it
performs poorly with respect to mimicking the UNIX security model, so
there is still room for improvement.  When we consider how to
implement the setuid functionality, we will also look into a secure
alternative to the library's usage of the shared memory
areas.</P>

<P>Cygwin does not yet support applications that use
multiple Windows threads, even though the library itself is
multi-threaded.  We expect to address this shortcoming through the use
of locks at strategic points in the DLL.  It would also be desirable
to implement support for POSIX threads.</P>

<P>Although Cygwin allows
the GNU development tools that depend heavily on UNIX semantics to
successfully run on Win32 hosts, it is not always desirable to use it.
A program using a perfect implementation of the library would still
incur a noticeable amount of overhead.  As a result, an important
future direction involves modifying the compiler so that it can
optionally link against the Microsoft DLLs that ship with both Win32
operating systems, instead of Cygwin.  This will give developers the
ability to choose whether or not to use Cygwin on a per-program
basis.</P>

<H2>9. Proprietary Alternatives</H2>

<P>When we started
developing Cygwin, alternatives to writing our own library either
did not exist or were not mature enough for our purposes.  Today, we
know of three proprietary alternatives to Cygwin: UWIN from AT&T
Laboratories, NuTCracker from DataFocus, and OpenNT from Softway
Systems.</P>

<P>UWIN<SUP><A HREF="#6">6</A></SUP> ("UNIX for Windows")
was developed by David Korn for AT&T Laboratories. Its architecture
and API appears to be quite similar to our library.  Its single
biggest advantage over Cygwin is probably its more complete support
for the UNIX security model.  UWIN binaries are available for free
non-commercial use, but its source code is not
available.</P>

<P>NuTCracker, by DataFocus, is another proprietary
product that is built on top of the Win32 subsystem.  Version 4.0 of
the product appears to be quite complete, including such features as
support for POSIX threads.</P>

<P>OpenNT from Softway Systems<SUP><A
HREF="#7">7</A></SUP> takes a markedly different approach by providing
a capable POSIX subsystem for Windows NT, implemented with the Windows
NT source code close at hand.  At least in principle, writing a
separate POSIX subsystem should result in better performance because
of the lack of overhead imposed when implementing a library on top of
the Win32 subsystem.  More importantly, by avoiding the compromises
inherent in supporting both Win32 and POSIX calls in one application,
it should be possible for OpenNT to conform more strictly to the
relevant standards.</P>

<P>However, there are two substantial drawbacks to
OpenNT's approach.  The first is that it is not possible to mix UNIX
and Win32 API calls in one application, a feature that is highly
desirable if you are attempting to do a full native Win32 port of a
UNIX program gradually, one module at a time.  The second drawback is
that OpenNT does not and cannot support Windows 95/98, a requirement
for many applications, including the GNUPro development
tools.</P>

<P>The lack of source code, coupled with the licensing fees
associated with each of these commercial offerings, might still have
required us to have written our own library if we were faced with the
same porting challenge today.</P>

<H2>10. Summary and Conclusions</H2>

<P>Cygwin is a UNIX-compatibility library that can
be used to port UNIX software to Win32 operating systems.  In this
paper, I have examined our motivations for writing Cygwin.  I have
analyzed its architecture in some detail, paying extra attention to
those areas where UNIX and Win32 differ the most.  I have listed
examples of successfully ported software and touched on performance
issues.  I have discussed where we expect to take Cygwin in the
future.  Finally, I have described the proprietary alternatives to our
library.</P>

<P>As you can see from the list of ported software
presented earlier in this paper, Cygwin can be used to facilitate
greatly the process of porting significant UNIX applications to Win32
hosts.  For some applications, it may be desirable to invest in a true
native Win32 port in order to remove the overhead imposed by Cygwin.
However, the increased portability and time saved by using Cygwin
should make it an attractive option in many
situations.</P>
