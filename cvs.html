<h1 align=center>Cygwin in CVS</h1>

<p>The sources to the core Cygwin libraries and utilities (winsup and
newlib) files are available via anonymous CVS access.  If you don't
know what CVS is, visit <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS">the
CVS home page</a> or read <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/cvs/cvs_toc.html">the CVS
Manual</a>.  You'll need a version with networking capabilities to
access this server.</p>

<p>To access the repository, you'll need to set the <tt>CVSROOT</tt>
environment variable as in these examples (if you are using a
different shell, you'll have to figure it out yourself):</p>

<pre>
95/NT	set    CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src
bash	export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src
csh	setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/src
</pre>

<p>Once you've done that, you need to tell your local cvs software
what password to use.  The password is the word
<tt>anoncvs </tt>:</p>

<pre>
bash$ cvs login
(Logging in to anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com)
CVS password: <i>anoncvs</i>
</pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> Windows users may need to make sure the
<tt>HOME</tt> environment variable is set to something meaningful.</p>

<p>After this, you shouldn't have to worry about passwords any more,
as it will store your password in <tt>$HOME/.cvspass</tt>
(semi-encoded).  In other words, don't type "<tt>cvs login</tt>"
again.</p>

<p>To get the Cygwin sources, do this:

<pre>
bash$ cvs checkout winsup
</pre>

<p>This will create a subdirectory called <tt>src</tt> and fill it
with the core sources.  Once you have the latest sources, "<tt>cvs
update</tt>" will get any changes since your last update.</p>

<h2>For developers with write access</h2>

<p>If you are a cygwin developer with a sourceware account, and
someone has told you that you have permission to write to
the sourceware cvs repository, the above information still applies
to you with two exceptions:

<ol>
<li>Replace <tt>:pserver:</tt> with <tt>:ext:</tt>
<li>Set <tt>CVS_RSH</tt> to the path to your <tt>ssh</tt> program
</ol>

If you don't know if you have write access or not, you don't have it.
