<h1 align="center">Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several.  They are listed below.</p>
<p>Please check out the <a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html">documentation</a>,
and the bug reporting <a href="http://cygwin.com/bugs.html">guidelines</a> before
sending email to a mailing list.

<p>Note that none of the below lists accept html mail.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a>: a <em>high volume</em> list
      for discussion of just about all things Cygwin-related.  If you have
      questions about how to use Cygwin, or any of its tools (bash, gcc, make, etc.),
      this is the list for you.  There is <b>one exception</b> to the "all things cygwin"
      nature of this list: questions about the Cygwin XFree86 project should go to the
      <a href="mailto:cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com">cygwin-xfree</a> mailing list (see below).
  </li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a>: a list for 
      discussion of all things related to Xfree86 on Cygwin. If you have
      questions about how to use, configure, install, build, or develop
      with <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/">XFree86 on Cygwin</a>,
      this is the list for you.  If you have general questions about
      using XFree86, please see www.xfree86.org or the
      <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/faq.html">Cygwin/XFree86 FAQ</a>.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list for those folks who want to avoid all the
      traffic.<br>
      Note that announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are automatically sent to
      the cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to subscribe to both mailing
      lists.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing issues regarding applications
      that are distributed with the Cygwin DLL</b>.  If you are maintaining one of
      the packages that is distributed with the Cygwin net releases you should be
      subscribed to this list.  This list is intended for discussing solutions.
      It is not for "it would be nice" type of musings.  Use the main cygwin
      mailing list for that.
      <p>Please use this mailing list for design discussions and bug reports regarding
      cygwin's setup.exe program.  This program is found in cygwin's <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/winsup/cinstall/?cvsroot=src"><tt>winsup/cinstall</tt></a>
      directory.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a>: a 
      list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL</b> and the other components
      of the "winsup" directory (if you aren't sure what this means, then you
      shouldn't be sending email here).  Discussions of supplied patches are also
      acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and all components of the "winsup" directory with the exception of
      the <tt>cinstall</tt> directory (see above).  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.  Subscription requests are
      handled on a case-by-case basis.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
      <b>Please do not join the cygwin-developers mailing list unless 1) you are thoroughly
      familiar with the cygwin DLL, 2) you have successfully built the DLL from source, and 3) you intend
      to contribute source code to the Cygwin DLL or its utilities.</b>
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a>: a list which receives log messages
      for every CVS commit in the 'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then
      you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to diffs
      of the changes.
  </p></li>
