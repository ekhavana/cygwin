<h1 align="center">Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several.  They are listed below.</p>
<p>However, please check out the <a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html">documentation</a>,
and the bug reporting <a href="http://cygwin.com/bugs.html">guidelines</a> before
sending email to a mailing list.</p>

<hr>
<a name="see-above"><h2 align="center">I have a question!  Should I just send it to one (or all) of the mailing lists
below?</h2></a>

<p>That depends.  Have you adequately researched your question already?
Cygwin is not a new project.  It's been around for more than four years.
That means that almost any question that you are burning to ask has
probably already been asked.  Almost every observation that you can make
has probably been made.  Almost every suggestion for improvement that
you can think of has probably been suggested.<p>

<p>So, rather than send YA "same old" observation to one of the mailing lists
below, and possibly be flamed as a result, you <em>owe it to yourself</em>
to do some background research before posting.</p>

<p>Places to check for information would be the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/faq/">Cygwin FAQ</a>, the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/docs.html">Cygwin documentation</a>, the <a
href="http://google.com/">web</a>, and the mailing list archives (click
on a mailing list name <a href="#available-lists">below</a> to search
the archive).  Using one of these methods, it's likely that you'll be
able to find the answers that you seek without sending email to
thousands of people and you'll have the satisfaction of having gained
valuable research skills.</p>

<p>This may seem like we're discouraging questions.  Well, you are
right.  We are discouraging <em>repeat</em> questions.  The Cygwin
mailing list is a <em>very</em> high volume list.  Every question you
send there will potentially be read by thousands of people.  Many people
will sigh and shake their heads when they see the same old question
asked for the hundredth time.  Is this how you want to introduce
yourself to the Cygwin community?  We think not.</p>

<p>Now that we've discouraged you, let us say that despite the fact that
there is an incredible number of messages going to the Cygwin mailing
lists, there are still a lot of friendly folk who will probably try to
answer your "newbie" (shudder) questions.  However, if you are going to
ask a question, you owe it to yourself and your new acquaintances to ask
an <a href="http://cygwin.com/bugs.html"><b>intelligent question</b></a>.
No one is "on staff" waiting for your email so no one needs to
respond to clueless, vague, content-free, or repetitive queries or
observations.  This means that if you <em>want to receive help</em> you
need to present yourself in such a fashion that people will want to help
you.  So, think thrice, post once.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure when you send a message to a Cygwin list that it
actually has <em>something to do with Cygwin</em>.  What do we mean by
that?  Well, if you can't install the Cygwin C compiler, then that has
something to do with Cygwin.  If you don't know C very well and need
some pointers on writing a program, that really has nothing to do with
Cygwin.  If you are trying to run the Cygwin version of <tt>bash</tt>
(the standard <b>UNIX</b> shell) and it hangs, then that's probably a
Cygwin problem.  If you can't figure out how to set up a command alias
in <tt>bash</tt>, that's <em>not</em> a Cygwin question.  These Cygwin
questions are considered "on topic".  The non-Cygwin questions are
considerd "off topic".</p>

<p>Why do we make this distinction?  For two reasons:  1) as mentioned,
the email traffic is very high so, by keeping things "on topic" we
can cut down on some list traffic and 2) there are usually much better
places on the intenet where you can get definitive answers for your
question.  It doesn't make sense to ask non-experts to teach you about
C or bash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't tell you exactly where to go with your non-cygwin
questions.  <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> is a wonderful resource
for finding things on the web, though.  It's likely that a few well-chosen
search terms will uncover scads of information.</p>
<p>'Nuff said.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="available-lists">Available Cygwin Mailing Lists</a></h1>
<p align="center">(Note that none of the below lists accept html mail.  Use straight text only)</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="cygwin"><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a></a>: a <em>high volume</em> list
      for <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of just about all things Cygwin-related.  If you have
      questions about how to use Cygwin, or if you have <em>cygwin-specific</em>
      (<a href="#see-above">see above</a>) questions about the UNIX tools (bash, gcc, make, etc.) that come with Cygwin,
      this is the list for you.  There is <b>one exception</b> to the "all things cygwin"
      nature of this list: questions about the Cygwin XFree86 project should go to the
      <a href="mailto:cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com">cygwin-xfree</a> mailing list (see below).
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-xfree"><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a></a>: a list for 
      <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of all things related to Xfree86
      on Cygwin. If you have questions about how to use, configure, install,
      build, or develop with <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/">XFree86 on Cygwin</a>,
      this is the list for you.  If you have general questions about
      using XFree86, please see www.xfree86.org or the
      <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/faq.html">Cygwin/XFree86 FAQ</a>.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-announce"><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list for those folks who want to avoid all the
      traffic.<br>
      Note that announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are automatically sent to
      the cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to subscribe to both mailing
      lists.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-apps"><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing issues regarding applications
      that are distributed with the Cygwin DLL</b>.  If you are maintaining one of
      the packages that is distributed with the Cygwin net releases you should be
      subscribed to this list.  This list is intended for discussing solutions.
      It is not for "it would be nice" type of musings.  Use the main cygwin
      mailing list for that.
      <p>Please use this mailing list for design discussions and bug reports regarding
      cygwin's setup.exe program.  This program is found in cygwin's <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/winsup/cinstall/?cvsroot=src"><tt>winsup/cinstall</tt></a>
      directory.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-patches"><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a></a>: a 
      list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL</b> and the other components
      of the "winsup" directory (if you aren't sure what this means, then you
      shouldn't be sending email here).  Discussions of supplied patches are also
      acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-developers"><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and all components of the "winsup" directory with the exception of
      the <tt>cinstall</tt> directory (see <a href="#cygwin-apps">cygwin-apps</a> above).  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.  Subscription requests are
      handled on a case-by-case basis.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
      <b>Please do not join the cygwin-developers mailing list unless 1) you are thoroughly
      familiar with the cygwin DLL, 2) you have successfully built the DLL from source, and 3) you intend
      to contribute source code to the Cygwin DLL or its utilities.</b>
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-cvs"><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a></a>: a list which receives log messages
      for every CVS commit in the 'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then
      you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to diffs
      of the changes.

<P>Before you send any mail to one of these lists, you need to read
the relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the <a
href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, and the 
<a href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list archives</a>

a bug that has aleady been reported.

<P>Any questions or problems with the mailing lists themselves should
