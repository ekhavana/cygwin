<h1 align="center">Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a>: a list for discussion of 
      all things Cygwin-related.  If you have questions about how to use Cygwin, or
      any of its tools (bash, gcc, make, etc.), <b>this is the list for you</b>.
      HTML mail is <b>NOT PERMITTED</b> on this list and will be stripped.
      <br>(traffic usually consists of 15-40 messages/day)
  </li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a>: a list for 
      discussion of discussion of all things related to Xfree86 on   
      Cygwin. If you have questions about how to use, configure, install,
      build, or develop with <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/">XFree86 on Cygwin</a>,
      this is the list for you. HTML mail is NOT PERMITTED on this list
      and will be stripped. If you have general questions about using XFree86,
      please see www.xfree86.org or the
      <a href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/faq.html">Cygwin/XFree86 FAQ</a>.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list for those folks who want to avoid all the
      traffic.<br>
      Note that announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are automatically sent to
      the cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to subscribe to both mailing
      lists.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and the other components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.  Subscription requests are
      handled on a case-by-case basis.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
      <b>Please do not join the cygwin-developers mailing list unless 1) you are thoroughly
      familiar with the cygwin DLL, 2) you have successfully built the DLL from source, and 3) you intend
      to contribute source code to the Cygwin DLL or its utilities.</b>
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and the other components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of
      supplied patches are also acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit
      email to this list.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing issues regarding applications
      that are distributed with the Cygwin DLL</b>.  If you are maintaining one of
      the packages that is distributed with the Cygwin net releases you should be
      subscribed to this list.  This list is intended for discussing solutions.
      It is not for "it would be nice" type of musings.  Use the main cygwin
      mailing list for that.
</p></li>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a>: a list which receives log messages
      for every CVS commit in the 'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then
      you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to diffs
      of the changes.
  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from any of the above lists by sending email to <b>themailinglistname-subscribe@cygwin.com</b> or <b>themailinglistname-unsubscribe@cygwin.com</b> respectively.</p>
