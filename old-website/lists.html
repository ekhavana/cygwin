<h1 align=center>Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  In fact there are three:

<ul>
  <li><b>cygwin</b>: a list for discussion of all things
      Cygwin-related (traffic usually consists of 15-40 messages/day)

  <li><b>cygwin-announce</b>: a moderated announcement list for those folks
      who want to avoid all the traffic.  (Note that mail sent to the
      moderated list is also sent to the discussion list so you should only
      need to be subscribed to one).

  <li><b>cygwin-developers</b>: a developers list for discussing the
      internals of the Cygwin library.  Please only join if you intend
      to contribute code to Cygwin.
</ul>

<P>To subscribe to the main list, send a message to
<a href="mailto:cygwin-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.

<P>To join the announcement list, send a message to
<a href="mailto:cygwin-announce-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-announce-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.

<P>The same method can be used to join the cygwin-developers list.

<P>In all three cases, the body and subject of the mail will be
ignored.  To unsubscribe, send a message to
<a href="mailto:cygwin-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>,
<a href="mailto:cygwin-announce-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-announce-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>, or
<a href="mailto:cygwin-developers-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-developers-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>,
depending on from which list you wish to unsubscibe.

<P>Before you send any mail to one of these lists, you need to read
the relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the <a
href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, and the <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/cygwin">mailing list archives</a>
so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or report
a bug that has aleady been reported.

<P>A digest is now available.  To subscribe to it, just tack -digest
to the name of the mailing list above.  E.g. send mail to
<a href="mailto:cygwin-digest-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin-digest-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>
to subscribe yourself to the digest of the main list.

<P>We try to actively reduce the amount of spam sent to the lists
by using the MAPS and ORBS relay blocking lists.  If your mail server
relays mail, note that it may be listed in one of these servers and
you will not be able to send mail to sourceware.cygnus.com.  Should
that be the case, contact your mail admin about fixing your mail
system.

<P>Questions or problems with the mailing lists should be directed to
<a href="mailto:postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com">postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.
