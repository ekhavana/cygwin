<h1 align=center>I'm still running Windows 95/98/Me, no Cygwin for me?</h1>

<p>Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me are really old and quite
crappy Windows versions which are missing important functionality and
are just not up to the times anymore.  With the introduction of Windows
XP a lot of projects stopped to support these versions long ago.
Beginning with Cygwin 1.7 we are performing this step as well and
concentrate on NT-based Windows versions.</p>

<p>However, as a curtesy to the occasional user of one of these systems,
we still provide the old 1.5.25 release of Cygwin.  Here's how you get
it:</p>

<p>To install Cygwin 1.5.25, download the legacy installer application
<a href="setup-legacy.exe"><b>setup-legacy.exe</b></a> and run it.</p>

<p>The legacy documentation for Cygwin 1.5.25 is still available for
reference.  There's the old
<a href="1.5/cygwin-ug-net/index.html"><b>User's Guide</b></a>, the old
<a href="1.5/faq.html"><b>FAQ</b></a>, and the old
<a href="1.5/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html"><b>API reference</b></a>.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this legacy version of Cygwin is not
supported any longer.  If you're running Windows 95, 98 or Me, there's
no problem to ask questions on the appropriate
<a href="lists.html">Cygwin mailing list</a>.  If you running any
other version of Windows, be prepared to be redirected to the latest
Cygwin release.</p>

<p>Just in case this information has been missed:  <b>The legacy Cygwin
release 1.5.25 is only kept available for the sake of Windows
95/98/Me users.</b>  It's <b>not supported</b> anymore and if you're using any
other version of Windows, install the latest Cygwin instead.
