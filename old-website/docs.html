<h2><a href="usenix-98/cygwin.html">Cygwin: A Free Win32 Porting
Layer for UNIX Applications</a></h2>

<P>On August 3, 1998, Geoffrey Noer presented this paper at the
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix-nt98/index.html">1998
Usenix NT Symposium</a>.  It provides an overview of the project and
also goes into the implementation of Cygwin in some detail.  The
paper is available in <a href="usenix-98/cygwin.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="usenix-98/cygwin.doc">Word 98</a>, and <a
href="usenix-98/cygwin.ps">Postscript</a> formats.

<h2><a href="faq_toc.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file</a></h2>

<P>There is a <a href="faq_toc.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> file
for the current beta release in html format.  It covers a lot of
ground, including installation help, version histories, release notes...
Here's a version of the
<a href="http://www.kt.rim.or.jp/~ksk/gnu-win32/index.html">
FAQ translated into Japanese</a>.

<h2>Cygwin API docs</h2>

<P>Some work remains to be done in documenting the Cygwin API.  A
partial (but useful) list of calls provided
by Cygwin are listed in the <a href="faq_toc.html">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> file.  The list can also be found in the source code
in winsup/doc/calls.texinfo.  To check if a call is provided but not
listed yet, check the source code file winsup/cygwin.din which may be
of some use.

<P>It is also possible to distill a fair amount of information from the
<a href="faq_toc.html">FAQ</a> and the
<a href="lists.html">project mailing lists</a>.

<h2>Development Tools</h2>

<p>Documentation for the development tools is available from the
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/" target="_top">main Cygnus site</a> in the 
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/pubs/gnupro/" target="_top">on-line documentation</a> section.

<h2>Writing DLLs</h2>

<P>We also have preliminary documents that discuss how to write
your own DLLs.  You have the choice of creating
<a href="building-dlls.txt">non-relocatable DLLs</a> or
<a href="building-reloc-dlls.txt">relocatable DLLs</a>.  You may also
want to read some <a href="dll-hints.txt">helpful hints</a> from
Gunther Ebert (gunther.ebert@ixos-leipzig.de).  And
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/gnu-win32/how-to-build-dlls.html"
target="_top"> here is some more information</a>, this time from
Fergus Henderson <fjh@cs.mu.oz.au>.  Once you've figured this out,
you might want to learn
<a href="dl-docs.html">how to use the dl family of calls</a> in your
dlls.

<h2>Stabs</h2>

<p>The tools use a
<a href="stabs_toc.html" target="_top">debugging info format called
<em>stabs</em></a>.  You can also find this document in GDB
(GNU Debugger) distributions.
Other preformatted versions (.txt, PostScript) are available
from <a href="ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/ftp.cygnus.com/gnu-win32/"
target="_top">the ftp location</a>.
