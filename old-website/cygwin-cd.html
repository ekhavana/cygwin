<H1 align=center>Cygwin on a CD</H1>

<P>Red Hat is no longer offering Cygwin 1.0 on CD.  There were tentative
plans to offer a new Cygwin CD sometime in early 2001.  These plans have
been shelved, however, and there are no further plans to provide a "box
product" offering for Cygwin.

<P>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
