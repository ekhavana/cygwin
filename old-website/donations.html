<p>Q: Is the Cygwin distribution free software?</p>

<p>A: Yes, it is.  You get to use the software for free.  The only "strings
attached" are that, in general, you must comply with the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.

<p>However, the fact that you can get the software for free doesn't mean that
there is no cost to the people involved in producing it for you.  The
people who bring you the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/">packages
in the Cygwin distribution</a> have often invested a <em>considerable</em>
amount of their personal time into the providing you with the best
possible Cygwin experience.  This is particularly true of the people
who <a href="http://cygwin.com/who.html">work on the Cygwin DLL</a> itself.
