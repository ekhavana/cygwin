<P>The Cygwin group at Cygnus consists primarily of four people:  DJ
Delorie, Christopher Faylor, and Geoffrey Noer.

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">Sourceware projects</a>,
contributions from net people are especially important.  Cygwin
benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of contributors,
including some incredible people like Mumit Khan and Sergey Okhapkin.
