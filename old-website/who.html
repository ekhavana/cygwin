<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<P>The Cygwin group at <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/">Cygnus
Solutions</a> consists primarily of two people:  Christopher
Faylor (manager) and DJ Delorie (senior engineer).

<P>Cygwin was originally designed and implemented by Steve Chamberlain
when he worked for Cygnus.

<P>Geoffrey Noer spearheaded Cygwin development for almost three years at Cygnus.
He provided many useful innovations to Cygwin as well as sheparding most of
Cygwin's development during that period.

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">Sourceware projects</a>,
contributions from net people are especially important.  Cygwin
benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of contributors,
including some incredible people like Mumit Khan and Sergey Okhapkin.

the leader in Open Source-based software development tools, mission
critical support, and custom engineering for the embedded systems
