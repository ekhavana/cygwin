<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<p>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat, Inc.)
and the project is still run by two employees from Red Hat, even though
there is very little further ongoing Cygwin development within Red Hat.

<p>Christopher Faylor (cgf) is one of the project leads and has led the project
through all of its recent innovations as well as acting as the primary
developer responsible for pathname and signal handling in the Cygwin
DLL.  Chris works at TimeSys but most of his Cygwin activities occur
on his own time.</p>

<p>Corinna Vinschen is the other project lead.  Corinna is a senior Red
Hat engineer who provides substantial Cygwin support, also in her spare
time.  Corinna is responsible for such important subsystems as security
and networking.</p>

<p>Harold L Hunt II was the lead for the <a
href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a> project.  Harold was the
driving force who has made Cygwin/X a fully functional, robust
implementation of X for Windows.</p>

<p><a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a> is currently led by
Alexander Gottwald who also manages the Win32-X11 project.</a>

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sources.redhat.com, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Sergey Okhapkin,
Egor Duda, Chuck Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason
Tishler, Robert Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin,
Chris January, Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, Pierre Humblet, Igor
Pechtchanski, Daniel Reed, Thomas Pfaff, and Brian Ford.</p>

<p>The Engineering Services branch of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">
Red Hat, Inc.</a> is a leader in Open Source-based software development
tools, mission critical support, and custom engineering for the embedded
systems market.  Cygwin is offered commercially as one of the offerings
in <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/gnupro/">the GNUPro
Toolkit</a>; development tools for 125 desktop and cross-platform
development environments.
