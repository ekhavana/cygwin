<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<P>The Cygwin group at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.
</a> consists primarily of two people: Christopher Faylor (manager) and
Corinna Vinschen (senior engineer).

<P>Cygwin was originally designed and implemented by Steve Chamberlain
when he worked for Cygnus.

<P>Geoffrey Noer led Cygwin development at Cygnus for almost three years
from 1996 - 1999.

<p>Chris Faylor is the current project lead and has led the project
through all of its recent innovations as well as acting as the primary
developer responsible for pathname and signal handling in the Cygwin
DLL.</p>

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sources.redhat.com, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Egor Duda, Chuck
Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason Tishler, Robert
Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin, Chris January, and
Conrad Scott.  (If you know of other contributors who you think should
be listed here, please let us know)

<p>The Engineering Services branch of <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.</a> is a leader in Open
Source-based software development tools, mission critical support, and
custom engineering for the embedded systems market.  Cygwin is offered
commercially as one of the offerings in
<li><a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/gnupro/">the GNUPro Toolkit</a>,
development tools for 125 desktop and cross-platform development
environments.
