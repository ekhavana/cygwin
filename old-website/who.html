<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<P>The Cygwin group at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.
</a> consists primarily of three people:  Christopher
Faylor (manager), DJ Delorie and Corinna Vinschen (senior engineers).

<P>Cygwin was originally designed and implemented by Steve Chamberlain
when he worked for Cygnus.

<P>Geoffrey Noer spearheaded Cygwin development at Cygnus for almost
three years from 1996 - 1999.  He provided many useful innovations to
Cygwin as well as sheparding most of Cygwin's development during that
period.

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a>,
contributions from net people are especially important.  Cygwin benefits
from thousands of testers and dozens of contributors, including some
incredible people like Mumit Khan, Sergey Okhapkin, Earnie Boyd, and
Egor Duda.
(If you know of other contributors who you think should be listed here,
please let us know)
