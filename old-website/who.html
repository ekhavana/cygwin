<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>

<P>The Cygwin group at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.
</a> consists primarily of three people: Christopher Faylor (manager),
Corinna Vinschen (senior engineer), DJ Delorie (senior engineer,
internal volunteer from the gcc group).

<P>Cygwin was originally designed and implemented by Steve Chamberlain
when he worked for Cygnus.

<P>Geoffrey Noer spearheaded Cygwin development at Cygnus for almost
three years from 1996 - 1999.  He provided many useful innovations to
Cygwin as well as sheparding most of Cygwin's development during that
period.

<p>Like many <a href="/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sources.redhat.com, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Egor Duda, Chuck
Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason Tishler, Robert
Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin, Chris January, and
Conrad Scott.  (If you know of other contributors who you think should
be listed here, please let us know)

<p>The Engineering Services branch of <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.</a> is a leader in Open
Source-based software development tools, mission critical support, and
custom engineering for the embedded systems market.  Our products
