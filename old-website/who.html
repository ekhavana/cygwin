<H1 align=center>Who are we?</H1>
<p>Christopher Faylor (cgf) is one of the project leads and has led the project
through all of its recent innovations as well as acting as the primary
developer responsible for pathname and signal handling in the Cygwin
DLL.  Chris works at TimeSys but most of his Cygwin activities occur
on his own time.</p>

<p>Corinna Vinschen (corinna) is the other project lead.  Corinna is a
senior Red Hat engineer who provides substantial Cygwin support, also in
her spare time.  Corinna is responsible for such important subsystems as
security and networking.</p>

<p><a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a> is currently led by
Alan Hourihane.</a>

<p>The <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">Cygwin setup</a> project
is currently led by Brian Dessent with notable contributions from Igor
Pechtchanski and Dave Korn.</p>

<p>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat,
Inc.) but there is little further ongoing Cygwin development within
Red Hat.</p>

<p>Please note that all of the above project leads prefer communicating
on the mailing list over private email.</p>

<p>Like many <a href="http://sourceware.org/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sourceware.org, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Sergey Okhapkin,
Egor Duda, Chuck Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason
Tishler, Robert Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin,
Chris January, Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, Pierre Humblet, Igor
Pechtchanski, Brian Dessent, Dave Korn, and Brian Ford.</p>
