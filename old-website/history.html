<h1 align=center>A Brief History of the Cygwin Project</h1>

<p>The first thing done was to enhance the development tools (gcc,
gdb, gas, et al) so that they could generate/interpret Win32 native
object files.

<P>The next task was to port the tools to Win NT/95.  We could have
done this by rewriting large portions of the source to work within the
context of the Win32 API.  But this would have meant spending a huge
amount of time on each and every tool.  Instead, we took a substantially
different approach by writing a shared library (the Cygwin DLL) that adds
the necessary UNIX-like functionality missing from the Win32 API (fork,
spawn, signals, select, sockets, etc.).  We call this new interface
the Cygwin API.  Once written, it was possible to build working Win32
tools using UNIX-hosted cross-compilers, linking against this library.

<P>From this point, we pursued the goal of producing native tools capable of
rebuilding themselves under Windows NT and 95 (this is often
called self-hosting).  Since neither OS ships with standard UNIX
user tools (fileutils, textutils, bash, etc...), we had to get the
GNU equivalents working with the Cygwin API.  Most of these tools were
previously only built natively so we had to modify their configure
scripts to be compatible with cross-compilation.  Other than the
configuration changes, very few source-level changes had to be made.
Running bash with the development tools and user tools in place,
Windows NT and 95 look like a flavor of UNIX from the perspective of the
GNU configure mechanism.  Self hosting was achieved as of the beta 17.1
release.

<P>As of the B20 release, the compiler is EGCS-based and supports a flag
that makes it possible to compile vanilla Win32 executables that don't
depend on the Cygwin POSIX-like layer.  The default is still to use
the Cygwin library.

<P>The current release is beta 20.
