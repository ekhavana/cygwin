<h3><center>What Is Cygwin?</center></h1>
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows.
It consists of two parts:
<li>A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation layer providing
substantial Linux API functionality.
<li>A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel.

<p>The Cygwin DLL currently works with all recent, commercially released
x86 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows, with the exception of Windows
CE.</p>

<p>Note that the official support for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me
will be discontinued with the
<a href="#beta-test"><b>next major version (1.7)</b></a> of Cygwin, which is
in <a href="#beta-test"><b>beta testing</b></a> right now.  Note that
Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the
<a href="#beta-test">1.7</a> version of Cygwin.</p>

<h3><center>What Isn't Cygwin?</center></h1>
<li>Cygwin is <b>not</b> a way to run native linux apps on Windows.  You have
to rebuild your application <em>from source</em> if you want it to run on Windows.
<li>Cygwin is <b>not</b> a way to magically make native Windows apps aware of UNIX &reg;
functionality, like signals, ptys, etc.  Again, you need to build your apps <em>from source</em>
if you want to take advantage of Cygwin functionality.

<center><h3>Installing and Updating Cygwin and its Packages</h3></center>
<p>Run <a href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> any time you want to update or
install a Cygwin package. The <a href="setup.exe.sig">signature</a> for <a
href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> can be used to verify the validity of
this binary using <a href="key/pubring.asc">this</a> public key.</p>

<p>When installing packages for the first time, <tt>setup.exe</tt>
<em>does not install every package</em>.  Only the <b>minimal base packages</b>
from the Cygwin distribution are installed by default.
Clicking on categories and packages in the <tt>setup.exe</tt> package installation
screen will provide you with the ability to control what is installed or updated.
Clicking on the "Default" field next to the "All" category will provide
you with the opportunity to install every Cygwin package.  Be advised
that this will download and install hundreds of megabytes to your
computer.  The best plan is probably to click on individual categories
and install either entire categories or packages from the categories
themselves.</p>

<! font size="-1">
<p>The latest net releases of the Cygwin DLL are numbered <i>1.n.x</i>,
where "n" is currently "5" (e.g., 1.5.25).  Any Cygwin program built
from December 1998 onward should work correctly with 1.n.x DLLs.</p>

<p>The <i>1.n.x</i> version numbering refers only to the Cygwin
DLL.  Individual packages like <em>bash</em>, <em>gcc</em>,
<em>less</em>, etc.  are released independently of the DLL.  The
<a href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> utility tracks the versions of all
installed components and provides the mechanism for <b>installing</b> or
<b>updating</b> everything available from this site for Cygwin.

<p>Once you've installed your desired subset of the Cygwin distribution,
<a href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> will remember what you selected so rerunning the
program will update your system with any new package releases.</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> We're in <b>beta-testing</b> for the new Cygwin
<b>release 1.7</b>.  This new release will come with <a href="http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-ug-net/ov-new1.7.html"><b>many changes</b></a>
and a whole bunch of <a href="http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-ug-net/ov-new1.7.html"><b>new features</b></a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to participate in the testing, just download
the <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup-1.7.exe"><b>new setup-1.7.exe</b></a>
and use that setup tool to install Cygwin 1.7.  Please note that Cygwin
1.7 will <b>NOT</b> run anymore on Windows 95, 98 or Me.</p>

<p>We also have a new User's Guide for 1.7, which is currently located at
<a href="http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html">http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html</a>.</p>

<p>We also have new matching API documentation located at
<a href="http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html">http://cygwin.com/1.7/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html</a>.</p>

<p>And, last but not least, we have a new FAQ, though very likely not quite
complete since we still don't know what exactly <b>is</b> a FAQ related to
Cygwin 1.7: <a href="http://cygwin.com/1.7/faq/faq.html">http://cygwin.com/1.7/faq/faq.html</a>.</p>

<p>Every couple of days the Beta release 1.7.0 is updated with a version
including the latest bugfixes and changes.  Announcements for these updates
are sent to the 
<a href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html#cygwin">Cygwin mailing list</a> and the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html#cygwin">Cygwin-Announce mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>The official 1.7.1 release should go public in late November or early December 2009.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this is a <b>TEST</b> release.  Don't use in
critical production environments.  Nevertheless I'd like to encourage
everyone to give 1.7 a try.  Due to internal changes it is possible to
install a 1.7 release in parallel to a 1.5 release and even run 1.7
processes in parallel to 1.5 processes.  The processes will not know
about each other!  Any try to interact between 1.7-based and 1.5-based
processes will lead to, at least, funny results.</p>

<p>To install a 1.7 release in parallel to a 1.5 release, all you have
to do is to choose another root directory (for instance: C:\cygwin-1.7)
in setup-1.7's "Choose Installation Directory" dialog.</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: Due to the way setup-1.7 works, you have to change the directory
right the first time you visit this dialog!  If you pressed the "Next"
button and then "Back" again, it's already too late and setup-1.7 will
create a broken 1.7 install.  If you pressed "Next" by mistake, exit
setup-1.7 and start it again.</p>

<p>Please report bugs and problems to
<a href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html#cygwin">the Cygwin mailing list</a> and,
<b>thanks for your participation</b>.
