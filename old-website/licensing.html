<h1 align=center>What are the licensing terms?</h1>

<p>Most of the tools are covered by the GNU GPL, some are public domain,
and others have a Berkeley style copyright.  To cover the GNU GPL
`restrictions', the basic rule is if you give out any binaries, you must
also make the source available.  For the full details, be sure to read
the text of the <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.

<P>The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the source
code is also covered by the GNU GPL.  By default, all executables link
against this library (and in the process include GPL'd Cygwin glue
code).  This means that unless you modify the tools so that compiled
executables do not make use of the Cygwin library, your compiled
programs will also have to be free software distributed under the GPL
with source code available to all.

<p>Cygnus' Native Win32 GNUPro subscriptions include a commercial
license for Cygwin that is more suitable for commercial use of the
Cygwin library.  Pricing for a GNUPro Subscription starts at
$6000 for three developers and includes GNUPro Toolkit, Developer
Support, and a commercial-use license for 100 copies of the Cygwin
library.  Contact <a href="mailto:info@cygnus.com">info@cygnus.com</a>
for more information about this license.  All other questions should
be sent to the project mailing list <a
href="mailto:cygwin@sourceware.cygnus.com">cygwin@sourceware.cygnus.com.
