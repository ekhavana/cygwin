Author: Octopod Group
Email:  info@octopod.net
Date:   2000-05-02
Text:   New version of Octopod 3.0 introduces a new
        technology called CodeToolbox. It allows developer
        to drag a code snippet (small piece of source code)
        from the special toolbox directly into the code
        (thus emulating the visual way of creating the user
        interface). Snippet is then written into the source
        code. Octopod comes with several dozens of
        snippets, all representing frequently typed code
        such as selecting the brush and pen into device
        context, deleting the file into the Recycle Bin
        etc. Along with this technology, Octopod got
        improved help file with complete how-to chapters,
        explanation of file formats etc. ActiveX support
        has also been improved, both in creating and
        importing the COM component. Class Wizard is
        extended and now includes templates of classes for
        Windows common controls.
