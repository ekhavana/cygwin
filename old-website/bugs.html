<h1 align=center>Where should I send bug reports?</h1>

First, you need to verify that your potential bug hasn't already been
reported by reading the <a href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a> and the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list
archives</a>.  If your issue is still unresolved, feel free to write
to the cygwin list with your problem.  <P>

Please consider investigating it yourself and sending us patches if you
figure out a solution.  Bug reports without solutions are also welcome --
send a detailed description (with a test case if possible)
to the <a href="mailto:cygwin@cygwin.com">Cygwin mailing list</a>
after reading our bug reporting guidelines.
Due to the mailing list volume, we don't always reply to individual bug
reports sent to the list but we do keep track of them.

<p>Eric S. Raymond has written a wonderful article on how to write <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">smart
questions</a>.  If you adhere to his guidelines, you'll have a very good
chance of getting a high-quality response to your bug.</p>

<h3><a name="personal-email">
Shouldn't I just send email to straight to a cygwin developer or package maintainer?<br>Isn't that more efficient than using a mailing list?  or
<br>I don't want to bother the list with my problem. or
<br>I'm not really sure if this is a bug and want to find out before I bother the list.</a></h3>

<p>The cygwin mailing list is absolutely the proper place for reporting
bugs.  In fact, there is generally no need to "Cc" a package maintainer
with your observations.  All maintainers should be reading the cygwin mailing
list so Ccing them will result in sending them two copies of your
email.</p>

<p>This is <em>particularly</em> true if you notice that someone has
<em>specifically</em> set the <em>Reply-To</em> of a message to go only to the
cygwin mailing list.  Some contributors actually set their return
address to <tt>cygwin@cygwin.com</tt> in an attempt to make it very
obvious that cygwin-related email should go to the mailing list.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some people still seem to insist on either Cc'ing
cygwin contributors or sending private email.  This is inconsiderate.
Please <b>do not do this</b> unless specifically requested.</p>

<H2>Bug reporting guidelines</H2>

<li>Use a subject line that describes the issue well: <P>

Good examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"1.1.8: select bug (NT and 95)" <br>
	"1.1.6: problem building perl" <br>
	"1.1.8: question about catting binary files in bash"
</blockquote>

Bad examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"question?"<br>
	"bug"<br>
	"porting problem"<br>
	"help!!!!"<br>
	"bash question"<br>
	"newbie needs help"
</blockquote>

This also applies to general discussion.  It's very hard to follow
the list when most of the subject lines look very similar. <P>

<li>In your description, show how to reproduce the problem.  This means
including a test case if at all possible. <P>

<li>At the very least, always include which cygwin beta release you are
using and give the operating system and its version number.  E.g.
"cygwin v1.1.9 under NT 4.0".<P>

<li>Run <tt>cygcheck -s -v -r &gt; cygcheck.out</tt> and include that in your
report.</p>

<li>Keep in mind that there are over 1500 people on the mailing list.  Try
to avoid "me too" responses or reporting problems that have already been
reported.  It's hard enough keeping up with the volume as it is... <P>

<li>Include a patch to fix the problem if you can.  Please see
<a href="contrib.html">how to contribute</a> for more information.
