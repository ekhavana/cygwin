<h1 align=center>Where should I send bug reports?</h1>

First, you need to verify that your potential bug hasn't already been
reported by reading the <a href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a> and the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list archives</a>.  If your
issue is still unresolved, feel free to write to the cygwin list with
your problem.  <P>

Please consider investigating it yourself and sending us patches if you
figure out a solution.  Bug reports without solutions are also welcome --
send a detailed description (with a test case if possible) to the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html">appropriate mailing list</a> after reading
our bug reporting guidelines.  Due to the mailing list volume, we don't
always reply to individual bug reports sent to the list but we do keep
track of them.

<p>Eric S. Raymond has written a wonderful article on how to write <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">smart
questions</a>.  If you adhere to his guidelines, you'll have a very good
chance of getting a high-quality response to your bug.</p>

<h3><a name="personal-email">
Shouldn't I just send email to straight to a cygwin developer or package maintainer?<a><font size=-1>
<blockquote>
	Isn't personal email more efficient than using a mailing list?&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>or</em><br>
	I don't want to bother the list with my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>or</em><br>
	I'm not really sure if this is a bug and want to find out before I bother the list.
</blockquote></li></font></h3>

<p>One of the cygwin mailing lists is absolutely the proper place for reporting
bugs.  The mailing lists were created for this express purpose.  Reporting bugs to a
public forum means that the workload is shared and, since your problem
will be read by many people, it may get more attention than one person
would be able to provide.</p>

<p>So, there is generally no need to "Cc" a package maintainer with your
observations.  All maintainers should be reading the appropriate mailing list
so Ccing them will result in sending them two copies of your email.</p>

<p>This is <em>particularly</em> true if you notice that someone has
<em>specifically</em> set the <tt>Reply-To</tt> of a message to go only
to the cygwin mailing list.  Some contributors even take this a step
further and actually set their return address to
the mailing list in an attempt to make it very obvious that
cygwin-related email should go to the mailing list.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some people still seem to insist on either Cc'ing
cygwin contributors or sending private email.  This is inconsiderate.
Please <b>do not do this</b> unless specifically requested.</p>

<H2>Bug reporting guidelines</H2>

<li>Use a subject line that describes the issue well: <P>

Good examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"1.1.8: select bug (NT and 95)" <br>
	"1.1.6: problem building perl" <br>
	"1.1.8: question about catting binary files in bash"
</blockquote>

Bad examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"question?"<br>
	"bug"<br>
	"porting problem"<br>
	"help!!!!"<br>
	"bash question"<br>
	"newbie needs help"<br>
	"Question for Jane Simmons"
</blockquote>

This also applies to general discussion.  It's very hard to follow
the list when most of the subject lines look very similar. <P>
<li>In your description, show how to reproduce the problem.  This means

including a test case if at all possible.</li><br>

<li>At the very least, always include which cygwin beta release you are
using and give the operating system and its version number.  E.g.
"cygwin v1.3.13 under NT 4.0".</li><br>

<li>Run <tt>cygcheck -s -v -r &gt; cygcheck.out</tt> and include that as an
attachment in your report. Please do <em>not</em> compress the output but include
it as a straight text file so that it can be easily viewed.</li><br>
<li>Avoid the use of exclamation marks or multiple question marks.  They add
nothing to the bug report and provide the impression that you are too excited
to calmly think about the problem.</li><br>
<li>Avoid personal details about why you need the bug fixed or how important
it is for you to have it fixed.  People will be more likely to look at your
problem if it is cut and dry, to the point, and uses a minimum of extra words.</li><br>
<li>Do not assume that your problem is so trivial or so "well known"
that it does not require any details or background from you.  Many
(most?) people who report bugs fall into the trap of assuming that
people are "clued into" their mental state when, in most cases, this is
not the case.

<p>As a rule of thumb, if you find yourself referring to your problem as
<em>the</em> problem with <tt>XYZ</tt> rather than <em>a</em> problem
with <tt>XYZ</tt> then your message is suspect.  Using <em>the</em> in
this context means that you are assuming that your problem is well known.
Unless you can point to an email message thread or FAQ entry (either of which
is a good idea, btw) please do not assume that the readers of your message will
be familiar with your problem.</li>
<li>Reporting that your problem "works fine" on some "other" UNIX platform or
used to work ok in a previous Cygwin release is marginally useful data.  However,
this does <em>not</em> guarantee that you've uncovered a Cygwin problem.
Cygwin can change its behavior between releases, sometimes to fix an
operational problem and sometimes, well... because we've introduced a bug.</p>
<p>With regard to differing behavior from some flavor of UNIX:
UNIXes vary in their behavior and Cygwin is basically a different flavor of UNIX.
This is <em>particularly</em> true of programs which rely on specific
malloc behavior, like being able to free a pointer twice or being able to
access memory after freeing.</p>
<p>Another common problem is attempting to modify the contents of a C "string".
On Cygwin (and many UNIXes) strings are stored in read-only memory.  So, it
is not possible to modify them.  You can change this behavior with the gcc
option <tt>-fwritable-strings</tt> but we suggest that it is better to change
your program.</p>
<p>Btw, "It worked in a previous version of cygwin" observations are only
relevant for modern versions of cygwin.  The "B series" versions of Cygwin
(B17, B18, B19, B20) are not modern versions.  Save your fingers and don't
even bother with comments about your experiences with these versions.</p>
<p>Many bug reporters seem to latch onto the fact that their problem is
not a problem in other versions of UNIX or Cygwin and mention this in
all followup email when people attempt to help them with the problem.
However, this information is usually only useful in the first message
and does not usually bear repeating.</p></li>

<li>Keep in mind that there are over 1500 people on the mailing list.  Try
to avoid "me too" responses or reporting problems that have already been
reported.  It's hard enough keeping up with the volume as it is...</li><br>

<li>Include a patch to fix the problem if you can.  Please see
<a href="contrib.html">how to contribute</a> for more information.</li>
