<h1 align=center>Where should I send bug reports?</h1>

First, you need to verify that your potential bug hasn't already been
reported by reading the <a href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a> and the
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/gnu-win32/">mailing list archives</a>.
If your issue is still unresolved, feel free to write to the gnu-win32
list with your problem.  <P>

Please consider investigating it yourself and sending us patches if you
figure out a solution.  Bug reports without solutions are also welcome --
send a detailed description (with a test case if possible)
to the <a href="mailto:gnu-win32@cygnus.com">GNU-Win32 mailing list</a>
after reading our bug reporting guidelines.
Due to the mailing list volume, we don't always reply to individual bug
reports sent to the list but we do keep track of them.

<H2>Bug reporting guidelines</H2>

<ul>
<li>Use a subject line that describes the issue well: <P>

Good examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"B19: select bug (NT and 95)" <br>
	"B18: problem building perl" <br>
	"B19: question about catting binary files in bash" <P>
</blockquote>

Bad examples: <br>
<blockquote>
	"bug" <br>
	"porting problem" <br>
	"help!!!!" <br>
	"bash question" <P>
</blockquote>

This also applies to general discussion.  It's very hard to follow
the list when most of the subject lines look very similar. <P>

<li>In your description, show how to reproduce the problem.  This means
including a test case if at all possible. <P>

<li>At the very least, always include which gnu-win32 beta release you are
using and give the operating system and its version number.  E.g.
"beta 17.1 under NT 4.0". <P>

<li>Keep in mind that there are over 1500 people on the mailing list.  Try
to avoid "me too" responses or reporting problems that have already been
reported.  It's hard enough keeping up with the volume as it is... <P>

<li>Include a patch to fix the problem if you can.  Please see
<a href="contrib.html">how to contribute</a> for more information.
</ul>
