Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of a DLL
(<code class="filename">cygwin1.dll</code>), which acts as an emulation layer
providing substantial <a href="http://www.pasc.org/#POSIX" target="_top">POSIX</a>
(Portable Operating System Interface) system call functionality, and a
collection of tools, which provide a Linux look and feel. The Cygwin DLL
works with all x86 and AMD64 versions of Windows NT since Windows NT 4.
The API follows the
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/nfindex.html" target="_top">Single
Unix Specification</a> as much as possible, and then Linux practice.
The major differences between Cygwin and Linux is the C library
(<code class="literal">newlib</code> instead of <code class="literal">glibc</code>).
</p><p>
With Cygwin installed, users have access to many standard UNIX
utilities.  They can be used from one of the provided shells such
as <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> or from the Windows Command Prompt.
Additionally, programmers may write Win32 console or GUI applications
that make use of the standard Microsoft Win32 API and/or the Cygwin API.
As a result, it is possible to easily port many significant UNIX
programs without the need for extensive changes to the source code.
This includes configuring and building most of the available GNU
software (including the development tools included with the Cygwin
distribution).

If you are new to the world of UNIX, you may find it difficult to
understand at first. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive,
so we recommend that you use the many available Internet resources
to become acquainted with UNIX basics (search for "UNIX basics" or
"UNIX tutorial"). 
</p><p>
To install a basic Cygwin environment, run the
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> program and click <code class="literal">Next</code>
at each page.  The default settings are correct for most users. If you
want to know more about what each option means, see 
<a href="#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called &#8220;Internet Setup&#8221;</a>. Use <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>
any time you want to update or install a Cygwin package.  If you are
installing Cygwin for a specific purpose, use it to install the tools
that you need. For example, if you want to compile C++ programs, you 
need the <code class="systemitem">gcc-g++</code> package and probably a text
editor like <code class="systemitem">nano</code>.  When running
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>, clicking on categories and packages in the
package installation screen will provide you with the ability to control
what is installed or updated. 
</p><p>
Another option is to install everything by clicking on the
<code class="literal">Default</code> field next to the <code class="literal">All</code>
category. However, be advised that this will download and install
several hundreds of megabytes of software to your computer. The best
plan is probably to click on individual categories and install either
entire categories or packages from the categories themselves.
After installation, you can find Cygwin-specific documentation in
the <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/</code> directory.
</p><p>
Developers coming from a Windows background will be able to write 
console or GUI executables that rely on the Microsoft Win32 API instead
of Cygwin using the -mno-cygwin option to GCC.  The <span><strong class="command">-shared</strong></span>
option allows to write Windows Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs).  The
resource compiler <span><strong class="command">windres</strong></span> is also provided.

If you are an experienced UNIX user who misses a powerful command-line
environment, you will enjoy Cygwin. Note that there are some workarounds
that cause Cygwin to behave differently than most UNIX-like operating
systems; these are described in more detail in 
<a href="#using-effectively" title="Using Cygwin effectively with Windows">the section called &#8220;Using Cygwin effectively with Windows&#8221;</a>.
</p><p>
Any time you want to update or install a Cygwin package, use the
graphical <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> program. By default,
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> only installs a minimal set of packages, 
so look around and choose your favorite utilities on the package
selection screen. You may also search for specfic tools on the Cygwin
website's <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">Setup Package
Search</a> For more information about what each option in
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> means, see <a href="#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called &#8220;Internet Setup&#8221;</a>. 
</p><p>
Another option is to install everything by clicking on the
<code class="literal">Default</code> field next to the <code class="literal">All</code>
category. However, be advised that this will download and install

entire categories or packages from the categories themselves.
After installation, you can find Cygwin-specific documentation in
the <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/</code> directory.
</p><p>
Developers coming from a UNIX background will find a set of utilities
they are already comfortable using, including a working UNIX shell.  The
compiler tools are the standard GNU compilers most people will have previously
used under UNIX, only ported to the Windows host.  Programmers wishing to port
UNIX software to Windows NT will find that the Cygwin library provides
an easy way to port many UNIX packages, with only minimal source code
changes.

A historical look into the first years of Cygwin development is
Geoffrey J. Noer's 1998 paper, "Cygwin32: A Free Win32 Porting Layer for
UNIX® Applications" which can be found at the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix-nt98/technical.html" target="_top">
2nd USENIX Windows NT Symposium Online Proceedings</a>.
</p></div><p>
Cygwin began development in 1995 at Cygnus Solutions (now part of Red Hat
Software).  The first thing done was to enhance the development tools 
(<span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">gdb</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">gas</strong></span>, 
etc.) so that they could generate and interpret Win32 native
object files.
The next task was to port the tools to Win NT/9x. We could have
done this by rewriting large portions of the source to work within the
context of the Win32 API. But this would have meant spending a huge
amount of time on each and every tool. Instead, we took a
substantially different approach by writing a shared library
(the Cygwin DLL) that adds the necessary UNIX-like functionality
missing from the Win32 API (<code class="function">fork</code>,
<code class="function">spawn</code>, <code class="function">signals</code>,
<code class="function">select</code>, <code class="function">sockets</code>, etc.).  We call this
new interface the Cygwin API. Once written, it was possible to build working
Win32 tools using UNIX-hosted cross-compilers, linking against this
library.</p><p>From this point, we pursued the goal of producing native tools
capable of rebuilding themselves under Windows 9x and NT (this is
often called self-hosting). Since neither OS ships with standard UNIX
user tools (fileutils, textutils, bash, etc...), we had to get the GNU
equivalents working with the Cygwin API. Most of these tools were
previously only built natively so we had to modify their configure
scripts to be compatible with cross-compilation. Other than the
configuration changes, very few source-level changes had to be
made. Running bash with the development tools and user tools in place,
Windows 9x and NT look like a flavor of UNIX from the perspective of
the GNU configure mechanism. Self hosting was achieved as of the beta
17.1 release in October 1996.</p><p>
The entire Cygwin toolset was available as a monolithic install. In
April 2000, the project announced a
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2000-04/msg00269.html" target="_top">
New Cygwin Net Release</a> which provided the native Win32 program
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> to install and upgrade each package
separately. Since then, the Cygwin DLL and <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> 
have seen continuous development.
</p><p>
The latest major improvement in this development is the 1.7 release in
2008, which dropped Windows 95/98/Me support in favor of using Windows
NT features more extensively.  It adds a lot of new features like
case-sensitive filenames, NFS interoperability, IPv6 support and much
more.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="highlights"></a>Highlights of Cygwin Functionality</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-intro"></a>Introduction</h3></div></div></div><p>When a binary linked
against the library is executed, the Cygwin DLL is loaded into the
application's text segment.  Because we are trying to emulate a UNIX kernel
which needs access to all processes running under it, the first Cygwin DLL to
run creates shared memory areas and global synchronization objects that other
processes using separate instances of the DLL can access.  This is used to keep track of open file descriptors and to assist fork and exec, among other
purposes.  Every process also has a per_process structure that contains
information such as process id, user id, signal masks, and other similar
process-specific information.</p><p>The DLL is implemented as a standard DLL in the Win32 subsystem.  Under
the hood it's using the Win32 API, as well as the native NT API, where
appropriate.</p><p>Because processes run under the standard Win32 subsystem, they
can access both the UNIX compatibility calls provided by Cygwin as well as
any of the Win32 API calls.  This gives the programmer complete flexibility in
designing the structure of their program in terms of the APIs used.  For
example, they could write a Win32-specific GUI using Win32 API calls on top of
a UNIX back-end that uses Cygwin.</p><p>The native NT API is used mainly for speed, as well as to access
NT capabilities which are useful to implement certain POSIX features, but
are hidden to the Win32 API.
</p><p>Due to some restrictions in Windows, it's not always possible
to strictly adhere to existing UNIX standards like POSIX.1.  Fortunately
these are mostely border cases.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-perm"></a>Permissions and Security</h3></div></div></div><p>Windows NT includes a sophisticated security model based on Access
Control Lists (ACLs).  Cygwin maps Win32 file ownership and permissions to
ACLs by default, on file systems supporting them (usually NTFS).  Solaris
style ACLs and accompanying function calls are also supported.
The chmod call maps UNIX-style permissions back to the Win32 equivalents. 
Because many programs expect to be able to find the
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> and
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code> files, we provide <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html" target="_top">utilities</a>
that can be used to construct them from the user and group information
provided by the operating system.</p><p>Users with Administrator rights are permitted to chown files.
With version 1.1.3 Cygwin introduced a mechanism for setting real and
effective UIDs. This is described in <a href="#ntsec" title="NT security">the section called &#8220;NT security&#8221;</a>.  As
of version 1.5.13, the Cygwin developers are not aware of any feature in
the Cygwin DLL that would allow users to gain privileges or to access
objects to which they have no rights under Windows.  However there is no
guarantee that Cygwin is as secure as the Windows it runs on. Cygwin
processes share some variables and are thus easier targets of denial of
service type of attacks.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-files"></a>File Access</h3></div></div></div><p>Cygwin supports
both POSIX- and Win32-style paths, using either forward or back slashes as the
directory delimiter.  Paths coming into the DLL are translated from POSIX to
native NT as needed.  From the application perspective, the file system is
a POSIX-compliant one.  The implementation details are safely hidden in the
Cygwin DLL.  UNC pathnames (starting with two slashes) are supported for
network paths.</p><p>Since version 1.7.0, the layout of this POSIX view of the Windows file
system space is stored in the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.  Actually,
there is a system-wide <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file as well as a
user-specific fstab file <code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d/${USER}</code>.</p><p>At startup the DLL has to find out where it can find the
<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.  The mechanism used for this is simple.
First it retrieves it's own path, for instance
<code class="filename">C:\Cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>.  From there it deduces
that the root path is <code class="filename">C:\Cygwin</code>.  So it looks for the
<code class="filename">fstab</code> file in <code class="filename">C:\Cygwin\etc\fstab</code>. 
The layout of this file is very similar to the layout of the
<code class="filename">fstab</code> file on Linux.  Just instead of block devices,
the mount points point to Win32 paths.  An installation with
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> installs a <code class="filename">fstab</code> file by
default, which can easily be changed using the editor of your choice.</p><p>In addition to selecting the root partition, the
<code class="filename">fstab</code> file allows mounting arbitrary Win32 paths into
the POSIX file system space.  A special case is the so-called cygdrive prefix.
It's the path under which every available drive in the system is mounted
under its drive letter.  The default value is <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code>,
so you can access the drives as <code class="filename">/cygdrive/c</code>,
<code class="filename">/cygdrive/d</code>, etc...  The cygdrive prefix can be set to
some other value (<code class="filename">/mnt</code> for instance) in the
<code class="filename">fstab</code> file(s).</p><p>The library exports several Cygwin-specific functions that can be used
by external programs to convert a path or path list from Win32 to POSIX or vice
versa.  Shell scripts and Makefiles cannot call these functions directly.
Instead, they can do the same path translations by executing the
<span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> utility program that we provide with Cygwin.</p><p>Win32 applications handle filenames case preserving but case
insensitive.  Cygwin supports case sensitivity on file systems supporting
that.  Since Windows XP, the OS only supports case sensitivity when a
specific registry value is changed.  Therefore case sensitivity is not
the default usually.</p><p>Symbolic links are not present and supported on Windows up to and
including Windows Server 2003 R2.  Only starting with Windows Vista,
native symlinks are available.  Unfortunately they are strangly implemented
and so not very useful for a POSIX emulation layer.  Consequentially
Cygwin recognizes them as symlinks but does not create them.</p><p>Symbolic links are potentially created in two different ways.
The file style symlinks are files containing a magic cookie followed by
the path to which the link points.  They are marked with the System DOS
attribute so that only files with that attribute have to be read to
determine whether or not the file is a symbolic link.  The shortcut style
symlinks are Windows shortcut files with a special header and the
Readonly DOS attribute set.  The advantage of file symlinks is speed,
the advantage of shortcut symlinks is the fact that they can be utilized
by non-Cygwin Win32 tools as well.</p><p>Hard links are fully supported on NTFS and NFS file systems.  On FAT
and some other file systems, the call falls back to simply copying the file,
a strategy that works in many cases.</p><p>On file systems which don't support unique persistent file IDs (FAT,
older Samba shares) the inode number for a file is calculated by hashing its
full Win32 path.  The inode number generated by the stat call always matches
the one returned in <code class="literal">d_ino</code> of the <code class="literal">dirent</code>
structure.  It is worth noting that the number produced by this method is not
guaranteed to be unique.  However, we have not found this to be a significant
problem because of the low probability of generating a duplicate inode number.
</p><p><code class="function">chroot(2)</code> is supported since Cygwin 1.1.3.
However, chroot is not a concept known by Windows.  This implies some
restrictions.  First of all, the <code class="function">chroot</code> call isn't a
privileged call.  Each user may call it.  Second, the chroot environment
isn't safe against native windows processes.  If you want to support a
chroot environment as, for example, by allowing an anonymous ftp with
restricted access, you'll have to care that only native Cygwin applications
are accessible inside of the chroot environment.  Since those applications
are only using the Cygwin POSIX API to access the file system their access
can be restricted as it is intended.  This includes not only POSIX paths but
Win32 paths containing drive letter and/or backslashes as well as UNC paths
(<code class="filename">//server/share</code> or <code class="filename">\\server\share</code>).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-textvsbinary"></a>Text Mode vs. Binary Mode</h3></div></div></div><p>Interoperability with other Win32 programs such as text editors was
critical to the success of the port of the development tools.  Most Red Hat
customers upgrading from the older DOS-hosted toolchains expected the new
Win32-hosted ones to continue to work with their old development
sources.</p><p>Unfortunately, UNIX and Win32 use different end-of-line terminators in
text files.  Consequently, carriage-return newlines have to be translated on
the fly by Cygwin into a single newline when reading in text mode.</p><p>This solution addresses the compatibility requirement at the expense of
violating the POSIX standard that states that text and binary mode will be
identical. Consequently, processes that attempt to lseek through text files can
no longer rely on the number of bytes read as an accurate indicator of position
in the file.  For this reason, the CYGWIN environment variable can be
set to override this behavior.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-ansiclib"></a>ANSI C Library</h3></div></div></div><p>We chose to include Red Hat's own existing ANSI C library
"newlib" as part of the library, rather than write all of the lib C
and math calls from scratch.  Newlib is a BSD-derived ANSI C library,
previously only used by cross-compilers for embedded systems
development.  Other functions, which are not supported by newlib have
been added to the Cygwin sources using BSD implementations as much as
possible.</p><p>The reuse of existing free implementations of such things
as the glob, regexp, and getopt libraries saved us considerable
effort.  In addition, Cygwin uses Doug Lea's free malloc
implementation that successfully balances speed and compactness.  The
library accesses the malloc calls via an exported function pointer.
This makes it possible for a Cygwin process to provide its own
malloc if it so desires.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-process"></a>Process Creation</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="function">fork</code> call in Cygwin is particularly interesting
because it does not map well on top of the Win32 API.  This makes it very
difficult to implement correctly.  Currently, the Cygwin fork is a
non-copy-on-write implementation similar to what was present in early
flavors of UNIX.</p><p>The first thing that happens when a parent process
forks a child process is that the parent initializes a space in the
Cygwin process table for the child.  It then creates a suspended
child process using the Win32 CreateProcess call.  Next, the parent
process calls setjmp to save its own context and sets a pointer to
this in a Cygwin shared memory area (shared among all Cygwin
tasks).  It then fills in the child's .data and .bss sections by
copying from its own address space into the suspended child's address
space.  After the child's address space is initialized, the child is
run while the parent waits on a mutex.  The child discovers it has
been forked and longjumps using the saved jump buffer.  The child then
sets the mutex the parent is waiting on and blocks on another mutex.
This is the signal for the parent to copy its stack and heap into the
child, after which it releases the mutex the child is waiting on and
returns from the fork call.  Finally, the child wakes from blocking on
the last mutex, recreates any memory-mapped areas passed to it via the
shared area, and returns from fork itself.</p><p>While we have some
ideas as to how to speed up our fork implementation by reducing the
number of context switches between the parent and child process, fork
will almost certainly always be inefficient under Win32.  Fortunately,
in most circumstances the spawn family of calls provided by Cygwin
can be substituted for a fork/exec pair with only a little effort.
These calls map cleanly on top of the Win32 API.  As a result, they
are much more efficient.  Changing the compiler's driver program to
call spawn instead of fork was a trivial change and increased
compilation speeds by twenty to thirty percent in our
tests.</p><p>However, spawn and exec present their own set of
difficulties.  Because there is no way to do an actual exec under
Win32, Cygwin has to invent its own Process IDs (PIDs).  As a
result, when a process performs multiple exec calls, there will be
multiple Windows PIDs associated with a single Cygwin PID.  In some
cases, stubs of each of these Win32 processes may linger, waiting for
their exec'd Cygwin process to exit.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-signals"></a>Signals</h3></div></div></div><p>When
a Cygwin process starts, the library starts a secondary thread for
use in signal handling.  This thread waits for Windows events used to
pass signals to the process.  When a process notices it has a signal,
it scans its signal bitmask and handles the signal in the appropriate
fashion.</p><p>Several complications in the implementation arise from the
fact that the signal handler operates in the same address space as the
executing program.  The immediate consequence is that Cygwin system
functions are interruptible unless special care is taken to avoid
this.   We go to some lengths to prevent the sig_send function that
sends signals from being interrupted.  In the case of a process
sending a signal to another process, we place a mutex around sig_send
such that sig_send will not be interrupted until it has completely
finished sending the signal.</p><p>In the case of a process sending
itself a signal, we use a separate semaphore/event pair instead of the
mutex.  sig_send starts by resetting the event and incrementing the
semaphore that flags the signal handler to process the signal.  After
the signal is processed, the signal handler signals the event that it
is done.  This process keeps intraprocess signals synchronous, as
required by POSIX.</p><p>Most standard UNIX signals are provided.  Job
control works as expected in shells that support
it.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-sockets"></a>Sockets</h3></div></div></div><p>Socket-related calls in Cygwin basically call the functions by the
same name in Winsock, Microsoft's implementation of Berkeley sockets, but
with lots of tweaks.  All sockets are non-blocking under the hood to allow
to interrupt blocking calls by POSIX signals.  Additional bookkeeping is
necessary to implement correct socket sharing POSIX semantics and especially
for the select call.  Some socket-related functions are not implemented at
all in Winsock, as, for example, socketpair.  Starting with Windows Vista,
Microsoft removed the legacy calls <code class="function">rcmd(3)</code>,
<code class="function">rexec(3)</code> and <code class="function">rresvport(3)</code>.
Recent versions of Cygwin now implement all these calls internally.</p><p>An especially troublesome feature of Winsock is that it must be
initialized before the first socket function is called.  As a result, Cygwin
has to perform this initialization on the fly, as soon as the first
socket-related function is called by the application.  In order to support
sockets across fork calls, child processes initialize Winsock if any
inherited file descriptor is a socket.</p><p>AF_UNIX (AF_LOCAL) sockets are not available in Winsock.  They are
implemented in Cygwin by using local AF_INET sockets instead.  This is
completely transparent to the application.  Cygwin's implementation also
supports the getpeereid BSD extension.  A yet missing feature is
descriptor passing, though.</p><p>Starting with release 1.7.0, Cygwin gets IPv6 support.  However, this
depends on the availability of the Windows IPv6 stack.  Up to Windows 2003,
the IPv6 stack is treated as "experimental" and it's not feature complete.
Full support is only available starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server
2008.  The newly implemented <code class="function">getaddrinfo</code> and
<code class="function">getnameinfo</code> functions are not dependent on the OS,
though.  Cygwin 1.7.0 adds replacement functions which implement the full
functionality for IPv4.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ov-hi-select"></a>Select</h3></div></div></div><p>The UNIX <code class="function">select</code> function is another
call that does not map cleanly on top of the Win32 API.  Much to our
dismay, we discovered that the Win32 select in Winsock only worked on
socket handles.  Our implementation allows select to function normally
when given different types of file descriptors (sockets, pipes,
handles, and a custom /dev/windows Windows messages
pseudo-device).</p><p>Upon entry into the select function, the first
operation is to sort the file descriptors into the different types.
There are then two cases to consider.  The simple case is when at
least one file descriptor is a type that is always known to be ready
(such as a disk file).  In that case, select returns immediately as
soon as it has polled each of the other types to see if they are
ready.  The more complex case involves waiting for socket or pipe file
descriptors to be ready.  This is accomplished by the main thread
suspending itself, after starting one thread for each type of file
descriptor present.  Each thread polls the file descriptors of its
respective type with the appropriate Win32 API call.  As soon as a
thread identifies a ready descriptor, that thread signals the main
thread to wake up.  This case is now the same as the first one since
we know at least one descriptor is ready.  So select returns, after
polling all of the file descriptors one last time.</p></div></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="setup-net"></a>Chapter 2. Setting Up Cygwin</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#internet-setup">Internet Setup</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-download">Download Source</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-dir">Selecting an Install Directory</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-localdir">Local Package Directory</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-connection">Connection Method</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-mirror">Choosing Mirrors</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-packages">Choosing Packages</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-progress">Download and Installation Progress</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-icons">Icons</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-postinstall">Post-Install Scripts</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#setup-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></span></dt></dl></dd><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#setup-env">Environment Variables</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#setup-maxmem">Changing Cygwin's Maximum Memory</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#ntsec">NT security</a></span></dt><dd><dl><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-common">NT security</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-files">File permissions</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-sids">NT SIDs in Cygwin</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-mapping">The mapping leak</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-aclfuncs">The ACL API</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-setuid">New setuid concept</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect2"><a href="#ntsec-switch">Switching User

The <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> installer is designed to be easy

Cygwin uses packages to manage installing various software. When
the default <code class="literal">Install from Internet</code> option is chosen,
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> creates a local directory to store
the packages before actually installing the contents. 
<code class="literal">Download from Internet</code> performs only the first
part (storing the packages locally), while 
<code class="literal">Install from Local Directory</code> performs only the 
second (installing the contents of the packages). 
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">Download from Internet</code> option is mainly
for creating a base Cygwin package tree on one computer for 
installation on several machines with 
<code class="literal">Install from Local Directory</code>; copy the
entire local package tree to another machine with the directory
tree intact. For example, you might create a <code class="literal">C:\cache\</code>
directory and place <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> in it. Run 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Install from Internet</code>
or <code class="literal">Download from Internet</code>, then copy the whole
<code class="literal">C:\cache\</code> to each machine and instead choose
<code class="literal">Install from Local Directory</code>. Unfortunately
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> does not yet support unattended installs.
</p><p>
Though this provides some basic mirroring functionality, if you
are managing a wide Cygwin installation, to keep up to date we recommend 
using a mirroring tool such as <span><strong class="command">wget</strong></span>. A helpful user on 
the Cygwin mailing list created a simple demonstration script to accomplish
this; search the list for <span><strong class="command">mkcygwget</strong></span> for ideas.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-dir"></a>Selecting an Install Directory</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <code class="literal">Root Directory</code> for Cygwin (default
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin</code>) will become <code class="literal">/</code> 
within your Cygwin installation. You must have write access to
the parent directory, and any ACLs on the parent directory will
determine access to installed files.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">Install For</code> options of <code class="literal">All Users</code> 
or <code class="literal">Just Me</code> should always be left on the default
<code class="literal">All Users</code>, unless you do not have write access to 
<code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> in the registry or the All Users 
Start Menu. This is true  even if you are the only user planning to use Cygwin 
on the machine.  Selecting <code class="literal">Just Me</code> will cause problems 
for programs such as <span><strong class="command">crond</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">sshd</strong></span>.
If you do not have the necessary permissions, but still want to use these
programs, consult the Cygwin mailing list archives about others' experiences.

</p><p>
The <code class="literal">Default Text File Type</code> should be left on
<code class="literal">Unix</code> (that is, <code class="literal">\n</code>) unless you
have a very good reason to switch it to 
<code class="literal">DOS</code> (that is, <code class="literal">\r\n</code>).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-localdir"></a>Local Package Directory</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <code class="literal">Local Package Directory</code> is the cache where 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> stores the packages before they are
installed. The cache must not be the same folder as the Cygwin
root. Within the cache, a separate directory is created for each
Cygwin mirror, which allows <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> to use 
multiple mirrors and custom packages. After installing Cygwin,
the cache is no longer necessary, but you may want to retain the
packages as backups, for installing Cygwin to another system,
or in case you need to reinstall a package.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-connection"></a>Connection Method</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <code class="literal">Direct Connection</code> method of downloading will 
directly download the packages, while the IE5 method will leverage your 
IE5 cache for performance. If your organisation uses a proxy server or
auto-configuration scripts, the IE5 method also uses these settings.
If you have a proxy server, you can manually type it into 
the <code class="literal">Use Proxy</code> section. Unfortunately, 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> does not currently support password
authorization for proxy servers.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-mirror"></a>Choosing Mirrors</h3></div></div></div><p>
Since there is no way of knowing from where you will be downloading
Cygwin, you need to choose at least one mirror site.  Cygwin mirrors 
are geographically distributed around the world; check the list at <a href="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html</a>
to find one near you. You can select multiple mirrors by holding down
<code class="literal">CTRL</code> and clicking on each one. If you have the URL of 
an unlisted mirror (for example, if your organization has an internal Cygwin 
mirror) you can add it.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-packages"></a>Choosing Packages</h3></div></div></div><p>
For each selected mirror site, <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> downloads a 
small text file called <code class="literal">setup.bz2</code> that contains a list
of packages available from that site along with some basic information about
each package which <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> parses and uses to create the 
chooser window. For details about the format of this file, see 
the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin-apps/setup.html" target="_top">
setup.exe homepage</a>.
</p><p>
The chooser is the most complex part of <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>. 
Packages are grouped into categories, and one package may belong to multiple 
categories (assigned by the volunteer package maintainer). Each package
can be found under any of those categories in the heirarchial chooser view.
By default <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>
will install only the packages in the <code class="literal">Base</code> category
and their dependencies, resulting in a minimal Cygwin installation.
However, this will not include many commonly used tools such as 
<span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span> (which you will find in the <code class="literal">Devel</code> 
category).  Since <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> automatically selects
dependencies, be careful not to unselect any required packages. In 
particular, everything in the <code class="literal">Base</code> category is
required.
</p><p>
You can change <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>'s view style, which is helpful
if you know the name of a package you want to install but not which 
category it is in. 
Click on the <code class="literal">View</code> button and it will rotate between 
<code class="literal">Category</code> (the default), <code class="literal">Full</code> (all 
packages), and <code class="literal">Partial</code> (only packages to be upgraded).
If you are familiar with Unix, you will probably want to at least glance 
through the <code class="literal">Full</code> listing for your favorite tools.
</p><p>
Once you have an existing Cygwin installation, the <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>
chooser is also used to manage your Cygwin installation. 
Information on installed packages is kept in the
<code class="literal">/etc/setup/</code> directory of your Cygwin installation; if 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> cannot find this directory it will act just like
you had no Cygwin installation.  If <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>
finds a newer version of an installed package available, it will automatically 
mark it to be upgraded. 
To <code class="literal">Uninstall</code>, <code class="literal">Reinstall</code>, or get the
<code class="literal">Source</code> for an existing package, click on 
<code class="literal">Keep</code> to toggle it. 
Also, to avoid the need to reboot after upgrading, make sure
to close all Cygwin windows and stop all Cygwin processes before 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> begins to install the upgraded package.
</p><p>
The final feature of the <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> chooser is for
<code class="literal">Previous</code> and <code class="literal">Experimental</code> packages.
By default the chooser shows only the current version of each package,
though mirrors have at least one previous version and occasionally there
is a testing or beta version of a package available. To see these package,
click on the <code class="literal">Prev</code> or <code class="literal">Exp</code> radio button.
Be warned, however, that the next time you run <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> 
it will try to replace old or experimental versions with the current
stable version. 
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-progress"></a>Download and Installation Progress</h3></div></div></div><p>
First, <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> will download all selected packages
to the local directory chosen earlier. Before installing, 
<span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> performs a checksum on each package. If the
local directory is a slow medium (such as a network drive) this can take
a long time. During the download and installation, <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>
show progress bars for the current task and total remaining disk space.

Last of all, <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> will run any post-install
scripts to finish correctly setting up installed packages. Since each
script is run separately, several windows may pop up. If you are 
interested in what is being done, see the Cygwin Package Contributor's
Guide at <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.html" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</a>
When the last post-install script is completed, <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> 
will display a box announcing the completion. A few packages, such as
the OpenSSH server, require some manual site-specific configuration. 
Relevant documentation can be found in the <code class="literal">/usr/doc/Cygwin/</code>

Unfortunately, the complex setup process means that odd problems can
occur. If you're having trouble downloading packages, it may be network
congestion, so try a different mirror and/or a different protocol (i.e.,
HTTP instead of FTP).  If you notice something is not working after
running setup, you can check the <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> log file
at <code class="literal">/var/log/setup.log.full</code>. Make a backup of this

Before starting bash, you may set some environment variables.  A .bat
file is provided where the most important ones are set before bash in
launched.  This is the safest way to launch bash initially.  The .bat
file is installed in the root directory that you specified during setup
and pointed to in the Start Menu under the "Cygwin" option.  You can
edit it this file your liking.</p><p>
The <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> variable is used to configure many global
settings for the Cygwin runtime system.  Initially you can leave
<code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> unset or set it to <code class="literal">tty</code> (e.g.
to support job control with ^Z etc...) using a syntax like this in the
DOS shell, before launching bash.  </p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">C:\&gt;</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>set CYGWIN=tty notitle glob</code></strong>
</pre><p>
The <code class="envar">PATH</code> environment variable is used by Cygwin
applications as a list of directories to search for executable files
to run.  This environment variable is converted from Windows format
(e.g. <code class="filename">C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows</code>) to UNIX format
(e.g., <code class="filename">/cygdrive/c/Windows/system32:/cygdrive/c/Windows</code>)
when a Cygwin process first starts.
Set it so that it contains at least the <code class="filename">x:\cygwin\bin</code>
directory where "<code class="filename">x:\cygwin</code> is the "root" of your
cygwin installation if you wish to use cygwin tools outside of bash.
This is usually done by the batch file you're starting your shell with.
</p><p> 
The <code class="envar">HOME</code> environment variable is used by many programs to
determine the location of your home directory and we recommend that it be
defined.  This environment variable is also converted from Windows format
when a Cygwin process first starts.  It's usually set in the shell
profile scripts in the /etc directory.
</p><p>
The <code class="envar">TERM</code> environment variable specifies your terminal
type.  It is automatically set to <code class="literal">cygwin</code> if you have
not set it to something else.
</p><p>The <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable is used by
the Cygwin function <code class="function">dlopen ()</code> as a list of
directories to search for .dll files to load.  This environment variable
is converted from Windows format to UNIX format when a Cygwin process
first starts.  Most Cygwin applications do not make use of the
<code class="function">dlopen ()</code> call and do not need this variable.
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="setup-maxmem"></a>Changing Cygwin's Maximum Memory</h2></div></div></div><p>
By default no Cygwin program can allocate more than 384 MB of memory 
(program+data).  You should not need to change this default in most 
circumstances.  However, if you need to use more real or virtual memory in 
your machine you may add an entry in the either the 
<code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> (to change the limit for all users) or 
<code class="literal">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> (for just the current user) section of 
the registry. 
</p><p>
Add the <code class="literal">DWORD</code> value <code class="literal">heap_chunk_in_mb</code> 
and set it to the desired memory limit in decimal MB. It is preferred to do 
this in Cygwin using the <span><strong class="command">regtool</strong></span> program included in the 
Cygwin package.
(For more information about <span><strong class="command">regtool</strong></span> or the other Cygwin 
utilities, see <a href="#using-utils" title="Cygwin Utilities">the section called &#8220;Cygwin Utilities&#8221;</a> or use each the
<code class="literal">--help</code> option of each util.)  You should always be careful 
when using <span><strong class="command">regtool</strong></span> since damaging your system registry can 
result in an unusable system.  This example sets memory limit to 1024 MB:

</p><pre class="screen">
regtool -i set /HKLM/Software/Cygwin/heap_chunk_in_mb 1024
regtool -v list /HKLM/Software/Cygwin
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Exit all running Cygwin processes and restart them. Memory can be allocated up 
to the size of the system swap space minus any the size of any running 
processes. The system swap should be at least as large as the physically 
installed RAM and can be modified under the System category of the 
Control Panel.  
</p><p>
Here is a small program written by DJ Delorie that tests the 
memory allocation limit on your system:

</p><pre class="screen">
main()
{
  unsigned int bit=0x40000000, sum=0;
  char *x;
  
  while (bit &gt; 4096) 
  {
    x = malloc(bit);
    if (x)
    sum += bit;
    bit &gt;&gt;= 1;
  }
  printf("%08x bytes (%.1fMb)\n", sum, sum/1024.0/1024.0);
  return 0;
}
</pre><p>

You can compile this program using:
</p><pre class="screen">
gcc max_memory.c -o max_memory.exe
</pre><p>

Run the program and it will output the maximum amount of allocatable memory.

<a href="#mount-table" title="The Cygwin Mount Table">mount option</a> <code class="literal">(no)acl</code>
which is set to <code class="literal">acl</code> by default.  The design goal
is to utilize the Windows access control API to implement real POSIX
permissions.</p><p>We start with a short overview.  Note that this overview must
be necessarily short.  If you want to learn more about the Windows security
model, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374860(VS.85).aspx" target="_top">Access Control</a> article in MSDN documentation.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-common"></a>NT security</h3></div></div></div><p>In the NT security model, almost any "object" is securable.
"Objects" are files, processes, threads, semaphores, etc.</p><p>Every object has a data structure called "security descriptor" (SD)
attached.  The SD contains all information necessary to control who can
how access an object.  The SD of an object consists of five parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>Flags which control several aspects of this SD. This is
not discussed here.</p></li><li><p>The SID of the object owner.</p></li><li><p>The SID of the object owner group.</p></li><li><p>A list of "Access Control Entries" (ACE), called the
"Discretionary Access Control List" (DACL).</p></li><li><p>Another list of ACEs, called the
"Security Access Control List" (SACL), which doesn't matter for our
purpose.</p></li></ul></div><p>Every ACE contains a so-called "Security IDentifier" (SID) and
other stuff which is explained a bit later.  Let's talk about the SID first.
</p><p>A SID is a unique identifier for users, groups, computers and AD
domains.  SIDs are basically comparable to POSIX UIDs and GIDs, but are
more complicated because they are unique across multiple machines or
domains.  A SID is a structure of multiple numerical values.  There's
a convenient convention to type SIDs.  Here's an example:</p><p>SID of a machine "foo":</p><pre class="screen">
  S-1-5-21-165875785-1005667432-441284377
</pre><p>SID of a user "johndoe" of the system "foo":</p><pre class="screen">
  S-1-5-21-165875785-1005667432-441284377-1023
</pre><p>The leading "S" has no further meaning except to show that this is
a SID.  The next number is a version number which is always 1 so far.
The next two numbers are the authority which shows the initiated what
kind of SID this is.  There are a couple of builtin accounts and
accounts with very special meaning. However, computer and domain SIDs
always start with "S-1-5-21".  The next three numbers, all 32 bit values,
are the unique 96 bit identifier of the comupter system.  This is
hopefully unique all over the world, but in practice it's sufficient if
the comuter SIDs are unique within a single Windows network.</p><p>As you can see in the above example, SIDs of users (and groups)
are identical to the computer SID, except for an additional part, the
so-called "relative identifier" (RID).  So the SID of a user is always 
uniquely attached to the system on which the account has been generated.</p><p>It's a bit different in domains.  The domain has its own SID, and
that SID is identical to the SID of the first domain controller, on
which the domain is created.  Domain user SIDs look exactly like the
computer user SIDs, the leading part is just the domain SID and the RID
is created when the user is created.</p><p>Ok, consider you created a new domain "bar" on some new domain
controller and you would like to create a domain account "johndoe":</p><p>SID of a domain "bar.local":</p><pre class="screen">
  S-1-5-21-186985262-1144665072-740312968
</pre><p>SID of a user "johndoe" in the domain "bar.local":</p><pre class="screen">
  S-1-5-21-186985262-1144665072-740312968-1207
</pre><p>Ok, so you now have two accounts called johndoe, one account
created on the machine "foo", one created in the domain "bar.local".
Both have different SIDs and not even the RID is the same.  How do
the systems know it's the same account?  After all, the name is
the same, right?  The answer is, these accounts are NOT identical.
For all the machines know there are two different accounts, one is
"FOO\johndoe", the other one is "BAR\johndoe" or "johndoe@bar.local".
Different SID, different account.  Full stop.
</p><p>The last part of the SID, the so called "Relative IDentifier" (RID),
is by default used as UID and/or GID under Cygwin when you create the
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> and <code class="filename">/etc/group</code>
files using the <span><strong class="command">mkpasswd</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">mkgroup</strong></span>
tools.  Domain account UIDs and GIDs are offset by 10000 by default
which might be a bit low for very big organizations.  Fortunately there's
an option in both tools to change the offset...</p><p>Do you still remember the SIDs with special meaning?  In offical
notation they are called "well-known SIDs".  For example, POSIX has no GID
for the group of "all users" or "world" or "others".  The last three rwx
bits in a permission value just represent the permissions for "everyone
who is not the owner or is member of the owning group".  Windows has a
SID for these poor souls, the "Everyone" SID.  Other well-known SIDs
represent more circumstances instead of actual users or groups.  Here
are a few examples for well-known SIDs:</p><pre class="screen">
Everyone                        S-1-1-0    Simply everyone...
Batch                           S-1-5-3    Processes started via the task
					   scheduler are member of this group.
Interactive			S-1-5-4    Only processes of users which are
					   logged in via an interactive
					   session are members here.
Authenticated Users             S-1-5-11   Users which have gone through
                                           the authentication process and
					   survived.  Anonymously accessing
					   users are not incuded here.
SYSTEM                          S-1-5-18   A special account which has all
					   kinds of dangerous rights, sort of
					   an uber-root account.
</pre><p>For a full list please refer to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379649.aspx" target="_top">Well-known SIDs</a>.
Naturally well-known SIDs are the same on each machine, so they are
not unique to a machine or domain.  They have the same meaning across
the Windows network.</p><p>Additionally there are a couple of well-known builtin groups,
which have the same SID on every machine and which have certain user
rights by default:</p><pre class="screen">
administrators                  S-1-5-32-544
users                           S-1-5-32-545
guests                          S-1-5-32-546
...
</pre><p>For instance, every account is usually member in the "Users"
group.  All administrator accounts are member of the "Administrators"
group.  That's all about it as far as single machines are involved.  In
a domain environment it's a bit more tricky.  Since these SIDs are not
unique to a machine, every domain user and every domain group can be a
member of these well known groups.  Consider the domain group "Domain
Admins".  This group is by default in the "Administrators" group.  Let's
assume the above computer called "foo" is a member machine of the domain
"bar.local".  If you stick the user "BAR\johndoe" into the group "Domain
Admins", this guy will automatically be a mamber of the administrators
group on "foo", when logging in on "foo".  Neat, isn't it?</p><p>Back to ACE and ACL.  POSIX is able to create three different
permissions, the permissions for the owner, for the group and for the
world.  In contrast the Windows ACL has a potentially infinite number of
members... as long as they fit into 64K.  Every member is an ACE.
ACE consist of three parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>The type of the ACE (allow ACE or deny ACE).</p></li><li><p>Permission bits, 32 of them.</p></li><li><p>The SID for which the permissions are allowed or denied.</p></li></ul></div><p>The two (for us) important types of ACEs are the "access allowed
ACE" and the "access denied ACE".  As the names imply, the allow ACE
tells the system to allow the given permissions to the SID, the deny ACE
results in denying the specific permission bits.</p><p>The possible permissions on objects are more detailed than in
POSIX.  For example, the permission to delete an object is different
from the permission to change object data, and even changing object data
can be separated into different permission bits for different kind of
data.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-files"></a>File permissions</h3></div></div></div><p>On NTFS and if the <code class="literal">noacl</code> mount option is not
specified for a mount point, Cygwin sets file permissions as in POSIX.
Basically this is done by defining a SD with the matching owner and group
SIDs, and a DACL which contains ACEs for the owner, the group and for
"Everyone", which represents what POSIX calls "others".</p><p>To use NT security correctly, Cygwin depends on the files
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> and <code class="filename">/etc/group</code>.
These files define the traslation between the Cygwin uid/gid and the
Windows SID.  The SID is stored in the pw_gecos field in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, and in the gr_passwd field in
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code>. Since the pw_gecos field can contain
more information than just a SID, there are some rules for the layout.
It's required that the SID is the last entry of the pw_gecos field,
assuming that the entries in pw_gecos are comma-separated.  The
commands <span><strong class="command">mkpasswd</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">mkgroup</strong></span>
usually do this for you.</p><p>Another interesting entry in the pw_gecos field (which is also
usually created by running <span><strong class="command">mkpasswd</strong></span>) is the Windows user
name entry.  It takes the form "U-domain\username" and is typically used
by services to authenticate a user.  Logging in through <span><strong class="command">ssh</strong></span>
or <span><strong class="command">telnet</strong></span> are two typical scenarios.
</p><p>A typical snippet from <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>:</p><div class="example"><a name="ntsec-passwd"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2.1. /etc/passwd:</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The SYSTEM entry is usually needed by services.  The Administrators
entry (Huh?  A group in /etc/passwd?) is only here to allow
<span><strong class="command">ls</strong></span> to print some file ownerships correctly.  Windows
doesn't care if the owner of a file is a user or a group.  In older
versions of Windows NT the default ownership for files created by an
administrator account was set to the group Administrators instead of to
the creating user account.  This has changed, but for those older
systems it's convenient to have the Administrators group in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>.</p><p>The really interesting entries are the next two.  The Administrator
entry is for the local administrator, the corinna entry matches the corinna
account in the domain BAR.  The information given in the pw_gecos field
are all we need to exactly identify an account, and to have a two way
translation, from Windows account name/SID to Cygwin account name uid and
vice versa.  Having this complete information allows us to choose a Cygwin
name and uid which doesn't have to match the Windows account at all.  As
long as the pw_gecos information is available, we're on the safe side:</p><div class="example"><a name="ntsec-passwd-tweaked"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2.2. /etc/passwd, tweaked:</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">

You can now login via <span><strong class="command">ssh</strong></span> as the user "root", and
Cygwin dutyfully translates "root" into the Windows user
"FOO\Administrators" and files owned by FOO\Administrators are shown to
have the uid 0 when calling <span><strong class="command">ls -ln</strong></span>.  All you do you're
actually doing as Administrator.  Files created as root will be owned by
FOO\Administrator.  And the domain user BAR\corinna can now happily
pretend to be Thursday Next, but will wake up sooner or later finding
out she's still actually the domain user BAR\corinna...</p><p>Do I have to mention that you can also rename groups in
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code>?  As long as the SID is present and correct,
all is well.  This allows for instance to rename the "Administrators" group
to "root" as well:</p><div class="example"><a name="ntsec-group-tweaked"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2.3. /etc/group, tweaked:</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
root:S-1-5-32-544:544:
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Last but not least you can also change the primary group of a user
in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>.  The only requirement is that the user
is actually a member of the new primary group in Windows.  For instance,
normal users in a domain environment are members in the group "Domain Users",
which in turn is member of the well-known group "Users".  Additionally let's
assume the user is also a member of the newly created group .  The default
primary group for users is 



</p><p>As you can see, I changed my primary group membership from 513 (None)
to 547 (powerusers).  So all files I created inside of Cygwin were now owned
by the powerusers group instead of None.  This is the way I liked it.</p><p>Groups may be mentioned in the passwd file, too. This has two
advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>Because NT assigns them to files as owners, a

if you're feeling comfortably with the concepts.  Otherwise don't be surprised
if some stuff doesn't work anymore.  If you screwed up things, revert to files
created by mkpasswd and mkgroup.  Especially don't change the UID or the name
of user SYSTEM.  Even if that works mostly, some Cygwin applications running
as local service under that account could suddenly start behaving strangely.

The official documentation explains in short the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>access allow ACEs are accumulated regarding to the
group membership of the caller.</p></li><li><p>The order of ACEs is important. The system reads them
in sequence until either any needed right is denied or all needed rights
are granted. Later ACEs are then not taken into account.</p></li><li><p>All access denied ACEs _should_ precede any
access allowed ACE.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that the last rule is a preference, not a law. NT will correctly
deal with the ACL regardless of the sequence order. The second rule is
not modified to get the ACEs in the preferred order.</p><p>Unfortunately the security tab of the NT4 explorer is completely
unable to deal with access denied ACEs while the explorer of W2K rearranges
the order of the ACEs before you can read them. Thank God, the sort order
remains unchanged if one presses the Cancel button.</p><p>You still ask "Where is the leak?" NT ACLs are unable to reflect each
possible combination of POSIX permissions. Example:</p><pre class="screen">
rw-r-xrw-
</pre><p>1st try:</p><pre class="screen">
UserAllow:   110
GroupAllow:  101
OthersAllow: 110
</pre><p>Hmm, because of the accumulation of allow rights the user may
execute because the group may execute.</p><p>2st try:</p><pre class="screen">
UserDeny:    001
GroupAllow:  101
OthersAllow: 110
</pre><p>Now the user may read and write but not execute. Better? No!
Unfortunately the group may write now because others may write.</p><p>3rd try:</p><pre class="screen">
UserDeny:    001
GroupDeny:   010
GroupAllow:  001
OthersAllow: 110
</pre><p>Now the group may not write as intended but unfortunately the user may
not write anymore, either. How should this problem be solved? According to
the official rules a UserAllow has to follow the GroupDeny but it's
easy to see that this can never be solved that way.</p><p>The only chance:</p><pre class="screen">
UserDeny:    001
UserAllow:   010
GroupDeny:   010
GroupAllow:  001
OthersAllow: 110
</pre><p>Again: This works for both, NT4 and W2K. Only the GUIs aren't
able to deal with that order.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-aclfuncs"></a>The ACL API</h3></div></div></div><p>For dealing with ACLs Cygwin now has the ACL API as it's
implemented in newer versions of Solaris. The new data structure
for a single ACL entry (ACE in NT terminology) is defined in
<code class="filename">sys/acl.h</code> as:</p><pre class="screen">
typedef struct acl {
  int     a_type;  /* entry type */
  uid_t   a_id;    /* UID | GID */
  mode_t  a_perm;  /* permissions */
} aclent_t;
</pre><p>The a_perm member of the aclent_t type contains only the bits
for read, write and execute as in the file mode. If e.g. read permission
is granted, all read bits (S_IRUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IROTH) are set.
CLASS_OBJ or MASK ACL entries are not fully implemented yet.</p><p>The new API calls are</p><pre class="screen">
acl(2), facl(2)
aclcheck(3),
aclsort(3),
acltomode(3), aclfrommode(3),
acltopbits(3), aclfrompbits(3),
acltotext(3), aclfromtext(3)
</pre><p>Like in Solaris, Cygwin has two new commands for working with
ACLs on the command line: <span><strong class="command">getfacl</strong></span> and
<span><strong class="command">setfacl</strong></span>.</p><p>Online man pages for the aforementioned commands and API calls can be
found on <a href="http://docs.sun.com" target="_top">http://docs.sun.com</a> </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-setuid"></a>New setuid concept</h3></div></div></div><p>POSIX applications which have to switch the user context are using
the <span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">seteuid</strong></span> calls which
are not part of the Windows API.
Nevertheless these calls are supported under Windows NT/W2K since Cygwin
release 1.1.3.  Because of the nature of NT security an application which
needs the ability has to be patched, though.</p><p>NT uses so-called `access tokens' to identify a user and it's
permissions. To switch the user context the application has to request
such an `access token'. This is typically done by calling the NT API
function <span><strong class="command">LogonUser</strong></span>. The access token is returned and
either used in <span><strong class="command">ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</strong></span> to change user
context of the current process or in <span><strong class="command">CreateProcessAsUser</strong></span>
to change user context of a spawned child process. An important restriction
is that the application using <span><strong class="command">LogonUser</strong></span> must have special
permissions:</p><pre class="screen">
"Act as part of the operating system"
"Replace process level token"
"Increase quotas"
</pre><p>Note that administrators do not have all these user rights set 
by default.</p><p>Two new Cygwin calls are introduced to support porting
<span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span> applications with a minimum of effort. You only
give Cygwin the right access token and then you can call
<span><strong class="command">seteuid</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span> as usual in POSIX
applications. The call to <span><strong class="command">sexec</strong></span> is not needed
anymore. Porting a <span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span> application is illustrated by
a short example:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-switch"></a>Switching User
Context</h3></div></div></div><p>
Since Cygwin release 1.3.3, applications that are members of the
Administrators group and have the <span><strong class="command">Create a token
object</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">Replace a process level token</strong></span> and
<span><strong class="command">Increase Quota</strong></span> user rights can switch user
context without giving a password by just calling the usual
<span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">seteuid</strong></span>,
<span><strong class="command">setgid</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">setegid</strong></span> functions.  
</p><p>
On NT and Windows 2000 the <code class="systemitem">SYSTEM</code> user has these privileges and can
run services such as <span><strong class="command">sshd</strong></span>. However, on Windows 2003
<code class="systemitem">SYSTEM</code> lacks the
<span><strong class="command">Create a token object</strong></span> right, so it is necessary to
create a special user with all the necessary rights, as
well as <span><strong class="command">Logon as a service</strong></span>, to run such services.
For security reasons this user should be denied the rights to logon
interactively or over the network. All this is done by configuration
scripts such as <span><strong class="command">ssh-host-config</strong></span>.
</p><p>
An important restriction of this method is that a process started
without a password cannot access network shares which require
authentication.  This also applies to subprocesses which switched user
context without a password.  Therefore, when using
<span><strong class="command">ssh</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">rsh</strong></span> without a password, it
is typically not possible to access network drives.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ntsec-ids"></a>Special values of user and group
ids</h3></div></div></div><p>
If the current user is not present in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>,
that user's user id is set to a special value of 400.  The user name for
the current user will always be shown correctly.  If another user
(or a Windows group, treated as a user) is not present in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, the user id of that user will have a
special value of -1 (which would be shown by <span><strong class="command">ls</strong></span> as
65535).  The user name shown in this case will be '????????'.
</p><p>
If the current user is not present in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>,
that user's login group id is set to a special value of 401.  If another
user is not present in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, that user's login
group id is set to a special value of -1.  If the user is present in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, but that user's group is not in
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code> and is not the login group of that user,
the group id is set to a special value of -1.  The name of this group
(id -1) will be shown as '????????'.
In releases of Cygwin before 1.3.20, the group id 401 had a group name
'None'.  Since Cygwin release 1.3.20, the group id 401 is shown as
'mkpasswd', indicating the command that should be run to alleviate the
situation.
</p><p>
Also, since Cygwin release 1.3.20, if the current user is present in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, but that user's login group is not
present in <code class="filename">/etc/group</code>, the group name will be shown
as 'mkgroup', again indicating the appropriate command.
</p><p>To summarize:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>If the current user doesn't show up in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, it's <span class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span> will
be named 'mkpasswd'.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, if the login group of the current user isn't
in <code class="filename">/etc/group</code>, it will be named 'mkgroup'.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise a group not in <code class="filename">/etc/group</code>
will be shown as '????????' and a user not in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> will be shown as "????????".</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that, since the special user and group names are just indicators,
nothing prevents you from actually having a user named `mkpasswd' in
<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> (or a group named `mkgroup' in
<code class="filename">/etc/group</code>).  If you do that, however, be aware of
the possible confusion.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="setup-files"></a>Customizing bash</h2></div></div></div><p>
To set bash up so that cut and paste work properly, click on the
"Properties" button of the window, then on the "Misc" tab.  Make sure
that "QuickEdit mode" and "Insert mode" are checked.  These settings
will be remembered next time you run bash from that shortcut. Similarly
you can set the working directory inside the "Program" tab. The entry
"%HOME%" is valid, but requires that you set <code class="envar">HOME</code> in
the Windows environment.
</p><p>
Your home directory should contain three initialization files
that control the behavior of bash.  They are
<code class="filename">.profile</code>, <code class="filename">.bashrc</code> and
<code class="filename">.inputrc</code>.  The Cygwin base installation creates
stub files when you start bash for the first time.</p><p>
<code class="filename">.profile</code> (other names are also valid, see the bash man
page) contains bash commands.  It is executed when bash is started as login
shell, e.g. from the command <span><strong class="command">bash --login</strong></span>.
This is a useful place to define and
export environment variables and bash functions that will be used by bash
and the programs invoked by bash.  It is a good place to redefine
<code class="envar">PATH</code> if needed.  We recommend adding a ":." to the end of
<code class="envar">PATH</code> to also search the current working directory (contrary
to DOS, the local directory is not searched by default).  Also to avoid
delays you should either <span><strong class="command">unset</strong></span> <code class="envar">MAILCHECK</code> 
or define <code class="envar">MAILPATH</code> to point to your existing mail inbox.
</p><p>
<code class="filename">.bashrc</code> is similar to
<code class="filename">.profile</code> but is executed each time an interactive
bash shell is launched.  It serves to define elements that are not
inherited through the environment, such as aliases. If you do not use
login shells, you may want to put the contents of
<code class="filename">.profile</code> as discussed above in this file
instead.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">
shopt -s nocaseglob
</pre><p>
will allow bash to glob filenames in a case-insensitive manner.
Note that <code class="filename">.bashrc</code> is not called automatically for login 
shells. You can source it from <code class="filename">.profile</code>.
</p><p>
<code class="filename">.inputrc</code> controls how programs using the readline
library (including <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span>) behave.  It is loaded
automatically.  For full details see the <code class="literal">Function and Variable
Index</code> section of the GNU <code class="systemitem">readline</code> manual.
Consider the following settings:
</p><pre class="screen">
# Ignore case while completing
set completion-ignore-case on
# Make Bash 8bit clean
set meta-flag on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on
</pre><p>
The first command makes filename completion case insensitive, which can
be convenient in a Windows environment.  The next three commands allow
<span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> to display 8-bit characters, useful for
languages with accented characters.  Note that tools that do not use
<code class="systemitem">readline</code> for display, such as
<span><strong class="command">less</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">ls</strong></span>, require additional
settings, which could be put in your <code class="filename">.bashrc</code>:
</p><pre class="screen">
alias less='/bin/less -r'
alias ls='/bin/ls -F --color=tty --show-control-chars'

environment and traditional UNIX systems. It assumes a working
knowledge of standard UNIX commands.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="using-pathnames"></a>Mapping path names</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-intro"></a>Introduction</h3></div></div></div><p>Cygwin supports both Win32- and POSIX-style paths, where
directory delimiters may be either forward or back slashes.  UNC
pathnames (starting with two slashes and a network name) are also
supported.</p><p>POSIX operating systems (such as Linux) do not have the concept
of drive letters.  Instead, all absolute paths begin with a
slash (instead of a drive letter such as "c:") and all file systems
appear as subdirectories (for example, you might buy a new disk and
make it be the <code class="filename">/disk2</code> directory).</p><p>Because many programs written to run on UNIX systems assume
the existance of a single unified POSIX file system structure, Cygwin
maintains a special internal POSIX view of the Win32 file system
that allows these programs to successfully run under Windows.  Cygwin
uses this mapping to translate from POSIX to Win32 paths as
necessary.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mount-table"></a>The Cygwin Mount Table</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file is used to map Win32
drives and network shares into Cygwin's internal POSIX directory tree.
This is a similar concept to the typical UNIX fstab file.  The mount
points stored in <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> are globally set for
all users.  Sometimes there's a requirement to have user specific
mount points.  The Cygwin DLL supports user specific fstab files.
These are stored in the directory <code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d</code>
and the name of the file is the Cygwin username of the user, as it's
stored in the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> file.  The content of the
user specifc file is identical to the system-wide
<code class="filename">fstab</code> file.</p><p>The file fstab contains descriptive information about the various file
systems.  fstab is only read by programs, and not written; it is the
duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this
file.  Each filesystem is described on a separate line; fields on each
line are separated by tabs or spaces.  Lines starting with '#' are
comments.</p><p>The first field describes the block special device or
remote filesystem to be mounted.  On Cygwin, this is the native Windows
path which the mount point links in.  As path separator you MUST use a
slash.  Usage of a backslash might lead to unexpected results.  UNC
paths (using slashes, not backslashes) are allowed.  If the path

If the name of the mount point contains spaces these can be
escaped as '\040'.</p><p>The third field describes the type of the filesystem.
Cygwin supports any string here, since the file system type is usually
not evaluated.  The noticable exception is the file system type
cygdrive.  This type is used to set the cygdrive prefix.</p><p>The fourth field describes the mount options associated
with the filesystem.  It is formatted as a comma separated list of
options.  It contains at least the type of mount (binary or text) plus
any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type.  Recognized
options are binary, text, nouser, user, exec, notexec, cygexec, nosuid,
posix=[0|1].  The meaning of the options is as follows.</p><pre class="screen">
  acl      - Cygwin uses the filesystem's access control lists (ACLs) to
             implement real POSIX permissions (default).  This flag only
	     affects filesystems supporting ACLs (NTFS) and is ignored
	     otherwise.
  noacl    - Cygwin ignores filesystem ACLs and only fakes a subset of
	     permission bits based on the DOS readonly attribute.  This
	     behaviour is the default on FAT and FAT32.  The flag is
	     ignored on NFS filesystems.
  binary   - Files default to binary mode (default).
  text     - Files default to CRLF text mode line endings.
  nouser   - Mount is a system-wide mount.
  user     - Mount is a user mount.
  exec     - Treat all files below mount point as executable.
  notexec  - Treat all files below mount point as not executable.
  cygexec  - Treat all files below mount point as cygwin executables.
  nosuid   - No suid files are allowed (currently unimplemented).
  posix=0  - Switch off case sensitivity for paths under this mount point.
  posix=1  - Switch on case sensitivity for paths under this mount point
	     (default).
</pre><p>Note that nouser mount points are not overridable by a later call
to mount(2).  This is only possible for user mount points.  Mount points
are by default nouser mount points, unless you specify the option user. 
In contrast, all mount points in the user specific fstab file are user
mount points.</p><p>The fifth and sixth field are ignored.  They are
so far only specified to keep a Linux-like fstab file layout.</p><p>Note that you don't have to specify an fstab entry for the root dir,
unless you want to have the root dir pointing to somewhere entirely
different (hopefully you know what you're doing), or if you want to
mount the root dir with special options (for instance, as text mount).</p><p>Example entries:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><p>Just a normal mount point:</p><pre class="screen">c:/foo /bar fat32 binary 0 0</pre></li><li><p>A mount point for a managed, textmode mount:</p><pre class="screen">C:/foo /bar/baz ntfs text,managed 0 0</pre></li><li><p>A mount point for a Windows directory with spaces in it:</p><pre class="screen">C:/Documents\040and\040Settings /docs ext3 binary 0 0</pre></li><li><p>A mount point for a remote directory:</p><pre class="screen">//server/share/subdir /srv/subdir smbfs binary 0 0</pre></li><li><p>This is just a comment:</p><pre class="screen"># This is just a comment</pre></li><li><p>Set the cygdrive prefix to /mnt:</p><pre class="screen">none /mnt cygdrive binary 0 0</pre></li></ul></div><p>Whenever Cygwin generates a Win32 path from a POSIX one, it uses
the longest matching prefix in the mount table.  Thus, if
<code class="filename">C:</code> is mounted as <code class="filename">/c</code> and also
as <code class="filename">/</code>, then Cygwin would translate
<code class="filename">C:/foo/bar</code> to <code class="filename">/c/foo/bar</code>.
This translation is normally only used when trying to derive the
POSIX equivalent current directory.  Otherwise, the handling of MS-DOS
filenames bypasses the mount table.
</p><p>If you want to see the current set of mount points valid in your

new mount points, and the <span><strong class="command">umount</strong></span> to delete

from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will
automatically default to an imaginary mount point under the default POSIX
path <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code>.  For example, if Cygwin accesses
<code class="filename">Z:\foo</code> and the Z drive is not currently in the
mount table, then <code class="filename">Z:\</code> would be automatically
converted to <code class="filename">/cygdrive/Z</code>.  The default
prefix of <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code> may be changed in the fstab file
as outlined above.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-additional"></a>Additional Path-related Information</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> program provides the ability to
translate between Win32 and POSIX pathnames in shell scripts. See
<a href="#cygpath" title="cygpath">the section called &#8220;cygpath&#8221;</a> for the details.</p><p>The <code class="envar">HOME</code>, <code class="envar">PATH</code>, and

converted from Win32 format to POSIX format (e.g.  from
<code class="filename">c:\cygwin\bin</code> to <code class="filename">/bin</code>, if
there was a mount from that Win32 path to that POSIX path) when a Cygwin
process first starts.</p><p>Symbolic links can also be used to map Win32 pathnames to POSIX.
For example, the command
<span><strong class="command">ln -s //pollux/home/joe/data /data</strong></span> would have about
the same effect as creating a mount point from
<code class="filename">//pollux/home/joe/data</code> to <code class="filename">/data</code>
using <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span>, except that symbolic links cannot set
the default file access mode.  Other differences are that the mapping is
distributed throughout the file system and proceeds by iteratively
walking the directory tree instead of matching the longest prefix in a
kernel table.  Note that symbolic links will only work on network
drives that are properly configured to support the "system" file
attribute.  Many do not do so by default (the Unix Samba server does
not by default, for example).</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="using-textbinary"></a>Text and Binary modes</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="textbin-issue"></a>The Issue</h3></div></div></div><p>On a UNIX system, when an application reads from a file it gets
exactly what's in the file on disk and the converse is true for writing.
The situation is different in the DOS/Windows world where a file can
be opened in one of two modes, binary or text.  In the binary mode the
system behaves exactly as in UNIX.  However on writing in text mode, a
NL (\n, ^J) is transformed into the sequence CR (\r, ^M) NL.
</p><p>This can wreak havoc with the seek/fseek calls since the number
of bytes actually in the file may differ from that seen by the
application.</p><p>The mode can be specified explicitly as explained in the Programming
section below.  In an ideal DOS/Windows world, all programs using lines as
records (such as <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">make</strong></span>,
<span><strong class="command">sed</strong></span> ...) would open files (and change the mode of their
standard input and output) as text.  All other programs (such as
<span><strong class="command">cat</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">cmp</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">tr</strong></span> ...)
would use binary mode.  In practice with Cygwin, programs that deal
explicitly with object files specify binary mode (this is the case of
<span><strong class="command">od</strong></span>, which is helpful to diagnose CR problems).  Most
other programs (such as <span><strong class="command">cat</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">cmp</strong></span>,
<span><strong class="command">tr</strong></span>) use the default mode.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="textbin-default"></a>The default Cygwin behavior</h3></div></div></div><p>The Cygwin system gives us some flexibility in deciding how files 
are to be opened when the mode is not specified explicitly. 
The rules are evolving, this section gives the design goals.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>If the filename is specified as a POSIX path and it appears to
reside on a file system that is mounted (i.e.  if its pathname starts
with a directory displayed by <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span>), then the
default is specified by the mount flag.  If the file is a symbolic link,
the mode of the target file system applies.</p></li><li><p>If the file is specified via a MS-DOS pathname (i.e., it contains a
backslash or a colon), the default is binary.
</p></li><li><p>Pipes and non-file devices are opened in binary mode,
except if the <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> environment variable contains
<code class="literal">nobinmode</code>.  Sockets are always opened in binary
mode.</p></li><li><p> When redirecting, the Cygwin shells uses rules (a-e). For
these shells the relevant value of <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> is that at the time
the shell was launched and not that at the time the program is executed.
Non-Cygwin shells always pipe and redirect with binary mode. With
non-Cygwin shells the commands <span><strong class="command"> cat filename | program </strong></span>
and <span><strong class="command"> program &lt; filename </strong></span> are not equivalent when
<code class="filename">filename</code> is on a text-mounted partition. </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="textbin-example"></a>Example</h3></div></div></div><p>To illustrate the various rules, we provide scripts to delete CRs
from files by using the <span><strong class="command">tr</strong></span> program, which can only write
to standard output. 
The script</p><pre class="screen">

#!/bin/sh
# Remove \r from the file given as argument
tr -d '\r' &lt; "$1" &gt; "$1".nocr

</pre><p> will not work on a text mounted systems because the \r will be 
reintroduced on writing. However scripts such as </p><pre class="screen">

#!/bin/sh
# Remove \r from the file given as argument
tr -d '\r' | gzip | gunzip &gt; "$1".nocr

</pre><p>and the .bat file</p><pre class="screen">

REM Remove \r from the file given as argument
@echo off
tr -d \r &lt; %1 &gt; %1.nocr

</pre><p> work fine. In the first case (assuming the pipes are binary)
we rely on <span><strong class="command">gunzip</strong></span> to set its output to binary mode,
possibly overriding the mode used by the shell.
In the second case we rely on the DOS shell to redirect in binary mode.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="textbin-question"></a>Binary or text?</h3></div></div></div><p>UNIX programs that have been written for maximum portability
will know the difference between text and binary files and act
appropriately under Cygwin.  For those programs, the text mode default
is a good choice.  Programs included in official Cygwin distributions
should work well in the default mode. </p><p>Text mode makes it much easier to mix files between Cygwin and
Windows programs, since Windows programs will usually use the CRLF
format.  Unfortunately you may still have some problems with text
mode.  First, some of the utilities included with Cygwin do not yet
specify binary mode when they should.
Second, you will introduce CRs in text
files you write, which can cause problems when moving them back to a
UNIX system. </p><p>If you are mounting a remote file system from a UNIX machine,
or moving files back and forth to a UNIX machine, you may want to
access the files in binary mode. The text files found there will normally
be in UNIX NL format, and you would want any files put there by Cygwin
programs to be stored in a format understood by UNIX.
Be sure to remove CRs from all Makefiles and
shell scripts and make sure that you only edit the files with
DOS/Windows editors that can cope with and preserve NL terminated lines.
</p><p>Note that you can decide this on a disk by disk basis (for
example, mounting local disks in text mode and network disks in binary
mode).  You can also partition a disk, for example by mounting
<code class="filename">c:</code> in text mode, and <code class="filename">c:\home</code>
in binary mode.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="textbin-devel"></a>Programming</h3></div></div></div><p>In the <code class="function">open()</code> function call, binary mode can be

Lists (ACLs) attached to a file.  This can be switched off by using the

<code class="filename">LPT1</code> or <code class="filename">PRN</code> (to name a few)
cannot be used in a native Win32 application, even with an

all of them are removed before the file is created.  This restriction does
only affect native Win32 applications.  Cygwin applications can create and
access files with trailing dots and spaces without problems.</p><p>Some characters are disallowed in filenames on Windows filesystems:</p><pre class="screen">
  "   *   :   &lt;   &gt;   ?   |   \

restriction.  All of the above characters, except for the backslash,

support case-sensitivity, the NT kernel starting with Windows XP does
not support it by default.  Rather, you have to tweak a registry setting

on by setting the registry value</p><pre class="screen">

this registry value also on Windows NT4 and Windows 2000, which usually
both don't know this registry key.  If you want case-sensitivity on these
systems, create that registry value and set it to 0.  On these systems
(and *only* on these systems) you don't have to reboot to bring it
into effect.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Note that when installing Microsoft's Services For Unix (SFU), you're asked if
you want to use case-sensitive filenames.  If you answer "yes" at this point,
the installer will change the aforementioned registry value to 0, too.  So, if
you have SFU installed, there's some chance that the registry value is already
set to case sensitivity.
</p></div><p>After you set this registry value to 0, Cygwin will be case-sensitive
by default on NTFS and NFS filesystems.  Be aware that using two filenames
which only differ by case might result in some weird interoperability
issues with native Win32 applications.  You're using case-sensitivity 
at your own risk.  You have been warned!</p><p>Even if you use case-sensitivity, it might be feasible to switch to
case-insensitivity for certain paths for better interoperability with
native Win32 applications (even if it's just Windows Explorer).  You can do
this on a per-mount point base, by using the "posix=0" mount option in
/etc/fstab, or your /etc/fstab.d/$USER file.</p><p>For a start, it might be best to switch the cygdrive path to
case-insensitivity, because the default Windows $PATH variable is not
always using the correct case by default.  As a result, your shell will
claim that it can't find Windows commands like <span><strong class="command">attrib</strong></span>
or <span><strong class="command">net</strong></span>.  Here's an example how you can switch the
cygdrive prefix to case-insensitivity:</p><div class="example"><a name="mount-caseinsensitive"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.2. Example mount point to enforce case-insensitivity on cygdrive paths</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">

paths like /proc are always case-sensitive!  The only exception are
the subdirs and filenames under /proc/registry, /proc/registry32

		console device on UNIX machines.

/dev/tty	The current tty of a session running in a pseudo tty.
/dev/ptmx	Pseudo tty master device.
/dev/ttym

/dev/tty0	Pseudo ttys are numbered from /dev/tty0 upwards as they are
/dev/tty1	requested.

/dev/ttyS0	Serial communication devices.  ttyS0 == Win32 COM1,
/dev/ttyS1	ttyS1 == COM2, etc.
...

/dev/pipe
/dev/fifo

/dev/mem	The physical memory of the machine.  Note that access to the
/dev/port	physical memory has been restricted with Windows Server 2003.
/dev/kmem	Since this OS, you can't access physical memory from user space.

/dev/kmsg	Kernel message pipe, for usage with sys logger services.

/dev/random	Random number generator.
/dev/urandom

/dev/dsp	Default sound device of the system.
</pre><p>
Cygwin also has several Windows-specific devices:
</p><pre class="screen">
/dev/com1	The serial ports, starting with COM1 which is the same as ttyS0.
/dev/com2	Please use /dev/ttySx instead.
...

/dev/conin	Same as Windows CONIN$.
/dev/conout	Same as Windows CONOUT$.
/dev/clipboard	The Windows clipboard, text only
/dev/windows	The Windows message queue.
</pre><p>
Block devices are accessible by Cygwin processes using fixed POSIX device
names.  These POSIX device names are generated using a direct conversion
from the POSIX namespace to the internal NT namespace.
E.g. the first harddisk is the NT internal device \device\harddisk0\partition0
or the first partition on the third harddisk is \device\harddisk2\partition1.
The first floppy in the system is \device\floppy0, the first CD-ROM is
\device\cdrom0 and the first tape drive is \device\tape0.  The mapping
to the POSIX /dev namespace is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">

<code class="filename">/proc</code> virtual filesystem. The files in this
directory are representations of various aspects of your system,
for example the command <strong class="userinput"><code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code></strong> 
displays information such as what model and speed processor you have.
</p><p>
One unique aspect of the Cygwin <code class="filename">/proc</code> filesystem
is <code class="filename">/proc/registry</code>, which displays the Windows
registry with each <code class="literal">KEY</code> as a directory and each
<code class="literal">VALUE</code> as a file. As anytime you deal with the
Windows registry, use caution since changes may result in an unstable
or broken system.  There are additionally subdirectories called
<code class="filename">/proc/registry32</code> and <code class="filename">/proc/registry64</code>.
They are identical to <code class="filename">/proc/registry</code> on 32 bit
host OSes.  On 64 bit host OSes, <code class="filename">/proc/registry32</code>
opens the 32 bit processes view on the registry, while
<code class="filename">/proc/registry64</code> opens the 64 bit processes view.
</p><p>
The Cygwin <code class="filename">/proc</code> is not as complete as the
one in Linux, but it provides significant capabilities. The
<code class="systemitem">procps</code> package contains several utilities
that use it.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-at"></a>The @pathnames</h3></div></div></div><p>To circumvent the limitations on shell line length in the native
Windows command shells, Cygwin programs expand their arguments
starting with "@" in a special way.  If a file
<code class="filename">pathname</code> exists, the argument
<code class="filename">@pathname</code> expands recursively to the content of
<code class="filename">pathname</code>. Double quotes can be used inside the
file to delimit strings containing blank space. 
Embedded double quotes must be repeated.
In the following example compare the behaviors of the bash built-in
<span><strong class="command">echo</strong></span> and of the program <span><strong class="command">/bin/echo</strong></span>.</p><div class="example"><a name="pathnames-at-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.3.  Using @pathname</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">

(e.g. pipe and COM ports) file opens default to binary mode 
(no CRLF translation) instead of text mode.  Defaults to set (binary
mode).  By default, devices are opened in binary mode, so this option
has little effect on normal cygwin operations.  Sockets are always
in binary mode.

It does affect two things, however.  For non-NTFS filesystems, this
option will control the line endings for standard output/input/error
for redirection from the Windows command shell.  It will also affect
the default translation mode of a pipe, although most shells set the
pipe to binary by default.
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">codepage:[ansi|oem|utf8]</code> - This option controls
which single- or multibyte character set is used for file and console
operations.  Windows is using UTF-16 characters internally and this
option specifies how 8-byte character sets are converted to UTF-16 and
vice versa.  The default setting is <code class="envar">ansi</code> which means,
conversion is based on the current ANSI codepage, typically 1252 in
many Western language versions of Windows.  The name originates from the
ANSI Latin1 (ISO 8859-1) standard, used in Windows 1.0, though the
character sets have since diverged from any standard.  The second
setting selects an older, DOS-based character set, containing various
line drawing and special characters.  It is called <code class="envar">oem</code>
since it was originally encoded in the firmware of IBM PCs by original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs).</p><p>If you find that some characters (especially non-US or 'graphical' ones)
do not display correctly in Cygwin, you can use this option to select an
appropriate codepage.  Finally, <code class="envar">utf8</code> treats all file names
and console characters as UTF-8 chars.  Please note that, for correct
operation, you have to set the environment variable LC_CTYPE to "C-UTF-8"
for the time being.  The reason is that newlib's multibyte conversion
functions require this setting.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)dosfilewarning</code> - If set, Cygwin will warn the
first time a user uses an "MS-DOS" style path name rather than a POSIX-style
path name.  Defaults to set.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)envcache</code> - If set, environment variable
conversions (between Win32 and POSIX) are cached.  Note that this may
cause problems if the mount table changes, as the cache is not invalidated
and may contain values that depend on the previous mount table
contents. Defaults to set.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)export</code> - If set, the final values of these
settings are re-exported to the environment as <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> again.
Defaults to off.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
<code class="envar">error_start:Win32filepath</code> - if set, runs 
<code class="filename">Win32filepath</code> when cygwin encounters a fatal error,
which is useful for debugging.  <code class="filename">Win32filepath</code> is
usually set to the path to <span><strong class="command">gdb</strong></span> or

<code class="filename">C:\cygwin\bin\gdb.exe</code>. 
There is no default set.

to copy memory some number of bytes at a time, in the above example 
32768 bytes (32Kb) at a time. The default is to copy as many bytes as 
possible, which is preferable in most cases but may slow some older systems
down.
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">proc_retry:n</code> - causes the <code class="function">fork()</code> and <code class="function">exec*()</code>

occur when processes are being started while a user is logging off.
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)glob[:ignorecase]</code> - if set, command line arguments
containing UNIX-style file wildcard characters (brackets, question mark,
asterisk, escaped with \) are expanded into lists of files that match 
those wildcards.
This is applicable only to programs running from a DOS command line prompt.
Default is set.</p><p>This option also accepts an optional <code class="literal">[no]ignorecase</code> modifer.
If supplied, wildcard matching is case insensitive.  The default is <code class="literal">noignorecase</code></p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)reset_com</code> - if set, serial ports are reset

on the client side, otherwise your applications won't be able to use the
XSI IPC function calls (<code class="function">msgget</code>,
<code class="function">semget</code>, <code class="function">shmget</code>, and friends)

reflects the name of the program currently running.  Default is not
set.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)tty</code> - if set, Cygwin enables extra support
(i.e., termios) for UNIX-like ttys in the Windows console. 
It is not compatible with some Windows programs.
Defaults to not set, in which case the tty is opened in text mode.
Note that this has been changed such that ^D works as
expected instead of ^Z, and is settable via <span><strong class="command">stty</strong></span>.
This option must be specified before starting a Cygwin shell

other terminals (i.e., rxvt or xterm). 
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p><code class="envar">(no)winsymlinks</code> - if set, Cygwin creates
symlinks as Windows shortcuts with a special header and the R/O attribute
set. If not set, Cygwin creates symlinks as plain files with a magic number,

  Cygserver is a program which is designed to run as a background service.
  It provides Cygwin applications with services which require security
  arbitration or which need to persist while no other cygwin application
  is running.
</p><p>
  The implemented services so far are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Control slave tty/pty handle dispersal from tty owner to other
    processes without compromising the owner processes' security.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>XSI IPC Message Queues.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>XSI IPC Semaphores.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>XSI IPC Shared Memory.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cygserver-command-line"></a>Cygserver command line options</h3></div></div></div><p>
  Options to Cygserver take the normal UNIX-style `-X' or `--longoption' form.
  Nearly all options have a counterpart in the configuration file (see below)
  so setting them on the command line isn't really necessary.  Command line
  options override settings from the Cygserver configuration file.
</p><p>
  The one-character options are prepended by a single dash, the long variants
  are prepended with two dashes.  Arguments to options are marked in angle
  brackets below.  These are not part of the actual syntax but are used only to
  denote the arguments.  Note that all arguments are required.  Cygserver
  has no options with optional arguments.
</p><p>
  The recognized options are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact><li><pre class="screen">-f, --config-file &lt;file&gt;</pre><p>  
    Use &lt;file&gt; as configuration file instead of the default configuration
    line.  The default configuration file is /etc/cygserver.conf, typically. 
    The --help and --version options will print the default configuration
    pathname.
  </p><p>
    This option has no counterpart in the configuration file, for obvious
   reasons.
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-c, --cleanup-threads &lt;num&gt;</pre><p>  
    Number of threads started to perform cleanup tasks.  Default is 2.
    Configuration file option:  kern.srv.cleanup_threads
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-r, --request-threads &lt;num&gt;</pre><p>  
    Number of threads started to serve application requests.  Default is 10.
    The -c and -r options can be used to play with Cygserver's performance
    under heavy load conditions or on slow machines.
    Configuration file option:  kern.srv.request_threads
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-d, --debug</pre><p>  
    Log debug messages to stderr.  These will clutter your stderr output with
    a lot of information, typically only useful to developers.
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-e, --stderr</pre><p>  
    Force logging to stderr.  This is the default if stderr is connected to
    a tty.  Otherwise, the default is logging to the system log.  By using
    the -e, -E, -y, -Y options (or the appropriate settings in the
    configuration file), you can explicitely set the logging output as you
    like, even to both, stderr and syslog.
    Configuration file option:  kern.log.stderr
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-E, --no-stderr</pre><p>  
    Don't log to stderr.  Configuration file option:  kern.log.stderr
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-y, --syslog</pre><p>  
    Force logging to the system log.  This is the default, if stderr is not
    connected to a tty, e. g. redirected to a file.
    Configuration file option:  kern.log.syslog
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-Y, --no-syslog</pre><p>  
    Don't log to syslog.  Configuration file option:  kern.log.syslog
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-l, --log-level &lt;level&gt;</pre><p> 
    Set the verbosity level of the logging output.  Valid values are between
    1 and 7.  The default level is 6, which is relatively chatty.  If you set
    it to 1, you will get only messages which are printed under severe conditions,
    which will result in stopping Cygserver itself.
    Configuration file option:  kern.log.level
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-m, --no-sharedmem</pre><p>  
    Don't start XSI IPC Shared Memory support.  If you don't need XSI IPC
    Shared Memory support, you can switch it off here.
    Configuration file option:  kern.srv.sharedmem
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-q, --no-msgqueues</pre><p>  
    Don't start XSI IPC Message Queues. 
    Configuration file option:  kern.srv.msgqueues
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-s, --no-semaphores</pre><p>  
    Don't start XSI IPC Semaphores.
    Configuration file option:  kern.srv.semaphores
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-S, --shutdown</pre><p>  
    Shutdown a running daemon and exit.  Other methods are sending a SIGHUP
    to the Cygserver PID or, if running as service, calling `net stop
    cygserver' or `cygrunsrv -E cygserver'.
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-h, --help</pre><p>  
    Output usage information and exit.
  </p></li><li><pre class="screen">-v, --version</pre><p>  
    Output version information and exit.
  </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="start-cygserver"></a>How to start Cygserver</h3></div></div></div><p>
  Before you run Cygserver for the first time, you should run the
  /usr/bin/cygserver-config script once.  It creates the default
  configuration file and, upon request, installs Cygserver as service.
  The script only performs a default install, with no further options
  given to Cygserver when running as service.  Due to the wide
  configurability by changing the configuration file, that's typically
  not necessary.
</p><p>
  You should always run Cygserver as a service under LocalSystem account. 
  This is the way it is installed for you by the /usr/bin/cygserver-config
  script.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="use-cygserver"></a>How to use the Cygserver services</h3></div></div></div><p>
  The Cygserver services are used by Cygwin applications only if you
  set the environment variable CYGWIN to contain the string "server".
  You must do this before starting the application.
</p><p>
  Typically, you don't need any other option, so it's ok to set CYGWIN
  just to "server".  It is not necessary to set the CYGWIN environment
  variable prior to starting the Cygserver process itself, but it won't
  hurt to do so.
</p><p>
  The easiest way is to set the environment variable CYGWIN to the values
  you want in the Windows system environment and to reboot the machine.
  This is advisable, since it allows you to set the variable once and
  then forget about it.  It also ensures that services as well as desktop
  applications have the same setting.
</p><p>
  If you don't want that for whatever reason, you can set the
  variable in the /cygwin.bat file which is used in the net distribution,
  to start a Cygwin bash from the desktop.  In that file, you can set
  the CYGWIN variable using Windows command line interpreter syntax, e. g.:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="screen">
    set CYGWIN=server
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  If you don't set CYGWIN in the system environment, but you're running
  other Cygwin services, these services need to get that CYGWIN value by
  setting the environment using the appropriate cygrunsrv option '-e' when
  installing the service.  Example installing a service 'foo':
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="screen">
    cygrunsrv -I foo -p /usr/sbin/foo -e "CYGWIN=server"
  </pre><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cygserver-config"></a>The Cygserver configuration file</h3></div></div></div><p>
  Cygserver has many options, which allow to customize the server
  to your needs.  Customization is accomplished by editing the configuration
  file, which is by default /etc/cygserver.conf.  This file is read only
  once on startup of Cygserver.  There's no option to re-read the file on
  runtime by, say, sending a signal to Cygserver.
</p><p>
  The configuration file determines how Cygserver operates.  There are
  options which set the number of threads running in parallel, options
  for setting how and what to log and options to set various maximum
  values for the IPC services.
</p><p>
  The default configuration file delivered with Cygserver is installed
  to /etc/defaults/etc.  The /usr/bin/cygserver-config script copies it to
  /etc, giving you the option to overwrite an already existing file or to
  leave it alone.  Therefore, the /etc file is safe to be changed by you,
  since it will not be overwritten by a later update installation.
</p><p>
  The default configuration file contains many comments which describe
  everything needed to understand the settings.  A comment at the start of the
  file describes the syntax rules for the file.  The default options are shown
  in the file but are commented out.
</p><p>
  It is generally a good idea to uncomment only options which you intend to
  change from the default values.  Since reading the options file on Cygserver
  startup doesn't take much time, it's also considered good practice to keep
  all other comments in the file.  This keeps you from searching for clues
  in other sources.

The <span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> program is a diagnostic utility for
dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with
<span><strong class="command">dpkg</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">rpm</strong></span>,
<span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> is similar in many ways. (The major difference
is that <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span> handles installing and uninstalling
packages; see <a href="#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called &#8220;Internet Setup&#8221;</a> for more information.)
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">-c</code> option checks the version and status of 
installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names,
<span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> will limit its output to those packages,
or with no arguments it lists all packages. A package will be marked
<code class="literal">Incomplete</code> if files originally installed are no longer
present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package
with <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>. To see which files are missing, use the
<code class="literal">-v</code> option. If you do not need to know the status
of each package and want <span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> to run faster, add the
<code class="literal">-d</code> option and <span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> will only
output the name and version for each package.
</p><p>
If you list one or more programs on the command line,
<span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> will diagnose the runtime environment of that
program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the program
depends.  If you specify the <code class="literal">-s</code> option,
<span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> will give general system information.  If you
list one or more programs on the command line and specify
<code class="literal">-s</code>, <span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> will report on
both.</p><p>
The <code class="literal">-f</code> option helps you to track down which package a
file came from, and <code class="literal">-l</code> lists all files in a package.
For example, to find out about <code class="filename">/usr/bin/less</code> and its

messages in the report, at the beginning of each section.  It also

adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report
or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-v</code> option causes the output to be more

that is relevent to Cygwin programs.  These registry entries are the
ones that have "Cygwin" in the name.  If you are paranoid about
privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep
in mind that doing so makes it harder to diagnose your problems.</p><p>In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are
installed on your local system, the <code class="literal">-p</code> option can be used
to search the entire official Cygwin package repository.  It takes as argument
a Perl-compatible regular expression which is used to match package names, 
package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents of packages.  This
feature requires an active internet connection, since it must query the
<code class="literal">cygwin.com</code> web site.  In fact, it is equalivant to the
search that is available on the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">Cygwin

certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:

</p><p>Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or wildcard.
This means that you need to use <code class="literal">.*</code> if you want something
similar to the wildcard <code class="literal">*</code> commonly used in filename globbing.
Similarly, to match the period character you should use <code class="literal">\.</code>
since the <code class="literal">.</code> character in a regexp is a metacharacter that
will match any character.  Also be aware that the characters such as 
<code class="literal">\</code> and <code class="literal">*</code> are shell metacharacters, so 
they must be either escaped or quoted, as in the example above.</p><p>The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole 
filename, you should include the <code class="literal">/</code> path seperator.  In the
given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
<code class="literal">ls.exe</code> such as <code class="literal">ncftpls.exe</code> are not shown.
Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with <code class="literal">ls</code>
in the root directory," since the <code class="literal">/</code> can match anywhere in the
path.  It's just there to anchor the match so that it matches a full
filename.</p><p>By default the matching is case-sensitive.  To get a case insensitive
match, begin your regexp with <code class="literal">(?i)</code> which is a PCRE-specific
feature.  For complete documentation on Perl-compatible regular expression
syntax and options, read the <span><strong class="command">perlre</strong></span> manpage, or one of many
websites such as <code class="literal">perldoc.com</code> that document the Perl
language.</p><p>The <span><strong class="command">cygcheck</strong></span> program should be used to send

</pre><p>The <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> program is a utility that
converts Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and
vice versa.  It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file 
name to a native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a
native Windows program.  Alternatively, <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> can 
output information about the location of important system directories 
in either format.  
</p><p>The <code class="literal">-u</code> and <code class="literal">-w</code> options
indicate whether you want a conversion to UNIX (POSIX) format 
(<code class="literal">-u</code>) or to Windows format (<code class="literal">-w</code>).  
Use the <code class="literal">-d</code> to get DOS-style (8.3) file and path names.
The <code class="literal">-m</code> option will output Windows-style format
but with forward slashes instead of backslashes.  This option is 
especially useful in shell scripts, which use backslashes as an escape 
character.</p><p> In combination with the <code class="literal">-w</code> option, you can use
the <code class="literal">-l</code> and <code class="literal">-s</code> options to use normal
(long) or DOS-style (short) form. The <code class="literal">-d</code> option is 
identical to <code class="literal">-w</code> and <code class="literal">-s</code> together.
</p><p>Caveat: The <code class="literal">-l</code> option does not work if the
<span class="emphasis"><em>check_case</em></span> parameter of <span class="emphasis"><em>CYGWIN</em></span> 
is set to <span class="emphasis"><em>strict</em></span>, since Cygwin is not able to match 
any Windows short path in this mode.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">-p</code> option means that you want to convert
a path-style string rather than a single filename.  For example, the
PATH environment variable is semicolon-delimited in Windows, but
colon-delimited in UNIX.  By giving <code class="literal">-p</code> you are
instructing <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> to convert between these
formats.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-i</code> option supresses the print out of the
usage message if no filename argument was given.  It can be used in
make file rules converting variables that may be omitted
to a proper format.  Note that <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> output may 
contain spaces (C:\Program Files) so should be enclosed in quotes.

<code class="literal">-S</code> might output C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM. 
The <code class="literal">-H</code> shows the Windows profiles directory that can 
be used as root of home.  The <code class="literal">-A</code> option forces use of 
the "All Users" directories instead of the current user for the 
<code class="literal">-D</code>, <code class="literal">-O</code> and <code class="literal">-P</code>

</pre><p>The <span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> utility can be used to create a
core dump of running Windows process. This core dump can be later loaded
to <span><strong class="command">gdb</strong></span> and analyzed. One common way to use 
<span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> is to plug it into cygwin's Just-In-Time 
debugging facility by adding

</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>

to the <span class="emphasis"><em>CYGWIN</em></span> environment variable. Please note that
<code class="literal">x:\path\to\dumper.exe</code> is Windows-style and not cygwin
path. If <code class="literal">error_start</code> is set this way, then dumper will
be started whenever some program encounters a fatal error.
</p><p>
<span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> can be also be started from the command line to 
create a core dump of any running process. Unfortunately, because of a Windows 
API limitation, when a core dump is created and <span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> 
exits, the target process is terminated too.
</p><p>
To save space in the core dump, <span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> doesn't write those
portions of target process' memory space that are loaded from executable and
dll files and are unchangeable, such as program code and debug info. Instead,
<span><strong class="command">dumper</strong></span> saves paths to files which contain that data. When a
core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these paths to load appropriate files.
That means that if you create a core dump on one machine and try to debug it on
another, you'll need to place identical copies of the executable and dlls in 
the same directories as on the machine where the core dump was created.

replaced by the output of <strong class="userinput"><code>crypt your_password</code></strong>
if remote access is desired.
To initially set up your machine if you are a local user, you'd do
something like this:</p><div class="example"><a name="utils-mkpasswd-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.9. Setting up the passwd file for local accounts</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir /etc</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mkpasswd -l &gt; /etc/passwd</code></strong>
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Note that this information is static.  If you change the user
information in your system, you'll need to regenerate the passwd file
for it to have the new information.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-d</code> and <code class="literal">-l</code> options
allow you to specify where the information comes from, the
local machine or the domain (default or given), or both.
With the  <code class="literal">-d</code> option the program contacts the Domain
Controller, which my be unreachable or have restricted access.
An entry for the current domain user can then be created by using the
option <code class="literal">-c</code> together with <code class="literal">-l</code>,
but <code class="literal">-c</code> has no effect when used with <code class="literal">-d</code>.
The <code class="literal">-o</code> option allows for special cases
(such as multiple domains) where the UIDs might match otherwise.
The <code class="literal">-g</code> option creates a local
user that corresponds to each local group. This is because NT assigns groups
file ownership.  The <code class="literal">-m</code> option bypasses the current
mount table so that, for example, two users who have a Windows home 
directory of H: could mount them differently.  The <code class="literal">-s</code>
option omits the NT Security Identifier (SID).  For more information on
SIDs, see <a href="#ntsec" title="NT security">the section called &#8220;NT security&#8221;</a> in the Cygwin User's Guide.  The
<code class="literal">-p</code> option causes <span><strong class="command">mkpasswd</strong></span> to
use the specified prefix instead of the account home dir or <code class="literal">/home/
</code>. For example, this command:

</p><div class="example"><a name="utils-althome-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.10. Using an alternate home root</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mkpasswd -l -p "$(cygpath -H)" &gt; /etc/passwd</code></strong>
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">

would put local users' home directories in the Windows 'Profiles' directory. 
On Win9x machines the <code class="literal">-u</code> option creates an entry for
the specified user. On the NT series it restricts the output to that user,
greatly reducing the amount of time it takes in a large domain.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mount"></a>mount</h3></div></div></div><pre class="screen">

to the current user.</p><p>The <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> utility is also the mechanism for
adding new mounts to the mount table.  The following example
demonstrates how to mount the directory
<code class="filename">\\pollux\home\joe\data</code> to <code class="filename">/data</code>.

command shell in the previous example.  In many Unix shells, including
bash, it is legal and convenient to use the forward "/" in Win32
pathnames since the "\" is the shell's escape character. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-s</code> flag to <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> is used to add a mount
in the system-wide mount table used by all Cygwin users on the system,
instead of the user-specific one.  System-wide mounts are displayed
by <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> as being of the "system" type, as is the
case for the <code class="filename">/</code> partition in the last example.
Under Windows NT, only those users with Administrator priviledges are
permitted to modify the system-wide mount table.</p><p>Note that a given POSIX path may only exist once in the user
table and once in the global, system-wide table.  Attempts to replace
the mount will fail with a busy error.  The <code class="literal">-f</code> (force) flag causes
the old mount to be silently replaced with the new one.  It will also
silence warnings about the non-existence of directories at the Win32
path location.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-b</code> flag is used to instruct Cygwin to treat binary and
text files in the same manner by default.  Binary mode mounts are
marked as "binmode" in the Flags column of <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span>
output.  By default, mounts are in text mode ("textmode" in the Flags
column).</p><p>Normally, files ending in certain extensions (.exe, .com, .bat, .cmd) 
are assumed to be executable.  Files whose first two characters begin with 
'#!' are also considered to be executable.  
The <code class="literal">-x</code> flag is used to instruct Cygwin that the 
mounted file is "executable".  If the <code class="literal">-x</code> flag is used 
with a directory then all files in the directory are executable.  
This option allows other files to be marked as executable and avoids the 
overhead of opening each file to check for a '#!'.  The <code class="literal">-X</code>
option is very similar to <code class="literal">-x</code>, but also prevents Cygwin
from setting up commands and environment variables for a normal Windows 
program, adding another small performance gain.  The opposite of these 
flags is the <code class="literal">-E</code> flag, which means that no files should be 
marked as executable.  </p><p>
The <code class="literal">-m</code> option causes the <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> utility
to output a series of commands that could recreate both user and system mount 
points. You can save this output as a backup when experimenting with the
mount table. It also makes moving your settings to a different machine
much easier.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">-o</code> option is the method via which various options about
the mount point may be recorded.  The following options are available (note that
most of the options are duplicates of other mount flags):</p><pre class="screen">
  user       - mount lives user-specific mount
  system     - mount lives in system table (default)
  binary     - files default to binary mode (default)
  text       - files default to CRLF text mode line endings
  exec       - files below mount point are all executable
  notexec    - files below mount point are not executable
  cygexec    - files below mount point are all cygwin executables
  nosuid     - no suid files are allowed (currently unimplemented)
  managed    - directory is managed by cygwin.  Mixed case and special
               characters in filenames are allowed.
</pre></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="utils-cygdrive"></a>Cygdrive mount points</h4></div></div></div><p>Whenever Cygwin cannot use any of the existing mounts to convert
from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will, instead,
convert to a POSIX path using a default mount point:
<code class="filename">/cygdrive</code>.  For example, if Cygwin accesses
<code class="filename">z:\foo</code> and the z drive is not currently in the
mount table, then <code class="filename">z:\</code> will be accessible as
<code class="filename">/cygdrive/z</code>.  The <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> utility 
can be used to change this default automount prefix through the use of the
"--change-cygdrive-prefix" option.  In the following example, we will
set the automount prefix to <code class="filename">/</code>:</p><div class="example"><a name="utils-cygdrive-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.13. Changing the default prefix</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">c:\cygwin\&gt;</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>mount --change-cygdrive-prefix /</code></strong>
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Note that the cygdrive prefix can be set both per-user and system-wide, 
and that as with all mounts, a user-specific mount takes precedence over the 
system-wide setting.  The <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> utility creates system-wide 
mounts by default if you do not specify a type.  Use the <code class="literal">-s</code> 
or <code class="literal">-u</code> flag to indicate a system or user mount, respectively.
You can always see the user and system cygdrive prefixes with the 
<code class="literal">-p</code> option.  Using the <code class="literal">-b</code>
flag with <code class="literal">--change-cygdrive-prefix</code> makes all new 
automounted filesystems default to binary mode file accesses.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="utils-limitations"></a>Limitations</h4></div></div></div><p>Limitations: there is a hard-coded limit of 30 mount
points.  Also, although you can mount to pathnames that do not start
with "/", there is no way to make use of such mount points.</p><p>Normally the POSIX mount point in Cygwin is an existing empty
directory, as in standard UNIX. If this is the case, or if there is a
place-holder for the mount point (such as a file, a symbolic link
pointing anywhere, or a non-empty directory), you will get the expected
behavior. Files present in a mount point directory before the mount
become invisible to Cygwin programs.
</p><p>It is sometimes desirable to mount to a non-existent directory,
for example to avoid cluttering the root directory with names
such as
<code class="filename">a</code>, <code class="filename">b</code>, <code class="filename">c</code>
pointing to disks.
Although <span><strong class="command">mount</strong></span> will give you a warning, most
everything will work properly when you refer to the mount point
explicitly.  Some strange effects can occur however.
For example if your current working directory is
<code class="filename">/dir</code>,
say, and <code class="filename">/dir/mtpt</code> is a mount point, then
<code class="filename">mtpt</code> will not show up in an <span><strong class="command">ls</strong></span>
or
<span><strong class="command">echo *</strong></span> command and <span><strong class="command">find .</strong></span> will
not
find <code class="filename">mtpt</code>.

<span><strong class="command">passwd</strong></span> also changes account information, such as
password expiry dates and intervals.</p><p>For password changes, the user is first prompted for their old
password, if one is present.  This password is then encrypted and

</p><p>The <code class="literal">add</code> action adds a new key.  The 
<code class="literal">check</code> action checks to see if a key exists (the 
exit code of the program is zero if it does, nonzero if it does not).
The <code class="literal">get</code> action gets the value of a value of a key,
and prints it (and nothing else) to stdout.  Note: if the value
doesn't exist, an error message is printed and the program returns a
non-zero exit code.  If you give <code class="literal">-q</code>, it doesn't
print the message but does return the non-zero exit code.</p><p>
The <code class="literal">list</code> action lists the subkeys and values
belonging to the given key. With <code class="literal">list</code>, the 
<code class="literal">-k</code> option instructs <span><strong class="command">regtool</strong></span>
to print only KEYs, and the <code class="literal">-l</code> option to print
only VALUEs. The <code class="literal">-p</code> option postfixes a 
<code class="literal">'/'</code> to each KEY, but leave VALUEs with no
postfix.  The <code class="literal">remove</code> action 
removes a key.  Note that you may need to remove everything in the key 
before you may remove it, but don't rely on this stopping you from 
accidentally removing too much.  
</p><p>The <code class="literal">set</code> action sets a value within a key.
<code class="literal">-b</code> means it's binary data (REG_BINARY).
The binary values are specified as hex bytes in the argument list.
If the argument is <code class="literal">'-'</code>, binary data is read
from stdin instead.
<code class="literal">-e</code> means it's an expanding string (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
that contains embedded environment variables.  
<code class="literal">-i</code> means the value is an integer (REG_DWORD).
<code class="literal">-m</code> means it's a multi-string (REG_MULTI_SZ).  
<code class="literal">-s</code> means the value is a string (REG_SZ).
If you don't specify one of these, <span><strong class="command">regtool</strong></span> tries to
guess the type based on the value you give.  If it looks like a
number, it's a DWORD.  If it starts with a percent, it's an expanding
string.  If you give multiple values, it's a multi-string.  Else, it's
a regular string.
The <code class="literal">unset</code> action removes a value from a key.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">load</code> action adds a new subkey and loads
the contents of a registry hive into it.
The parent key must be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS.
The <code class="literal">unload</code> action unloads the file and removes
the subkey.
</p><p>The <code class="literal">save</code> action saves a subkey into a
registry hive.
</p><p>
By default, the last "\" or "/" is assumed to be the separator between the
key and the value.  You can use the <code class="literal">-K</code> option to provide 
an alternate key/value separator character.

</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>perm</em></span> is either a 3-char permissions string in the form

SSP - The Single Step Profiler
</p><p>
Original Author:  DJ Delorie 
</p><p>
The SSP is a program that uses the Win32 debug API to run a program
one ASM instruction at a time.  It records the location of each
instruction used, how many times that instruction is used, and all
function calls.  The results are saved in a format that is usable by
the profiling program <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span>, although 
<span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> will claim the values
are seconds, they really are instruction counts.  More on that later.
</p><p>
Because the SSP was originally designed to profile the cygwin DLL, it
does not automatically select a block of code to report statistics on.
You must specify the range of memory addresses to keep track of
manually, but it's not hard to figure out what to specify.  Use the
"objdump" program to determine the bounds of the target's ".text"
section.  Let's say we're profiling cygwin1.dll.  Make sure you've
built it with debug symbols (else <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> won't run) 
and run objdump like this:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ objdump -h cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>

It will print a report like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
cygwin1.dll:     file format pei-i386

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .text         0007ea00  61001000  61001000  00000400  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE, DATA
  1 .data         00008000  61080000  61080000  0007ee00  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  . . .
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The only information we're concerned with are the VMA of 
the .text section and the VMA of the section after it 
(sections are usually contiguous; you can also add the 
Size to the VMA to get the end address).  In this case, 
the VMA is 0x61001000 and the ending address is either 
0x61080000 (start of .data method) or 0x0x6107fa00 (VMA+Size
method).
</p><p>
There are two basic ways to use SSP - either profiling a whole
program, or selectively profiling parts of the program.
</p><p>
To profile a whole program, just run <span><strong class="command">ssp</strong></span> without options.  
By default, it will step the whole program.  Here's a simple example, using 
the numbers above:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</pre><p>

This will step the whole program.  It will take at least 8 minutes on
a PII/300 (yes, really).  When it's done, it will create a file called
"gmon.out".  You can turn this data file into a readable report with
<span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span>:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ gprof -b cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>

The "-b" means 'skip the help pages'.  You can omit this until you're
familiar with the report layout.  The <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> documentation 
explains a lot about this report, but <span><strong class="command">ssp</strong></span> changes a few 
things.  For example, the first part of the report reports the amount of time 
spent in each function, like this:

</p><pre class="screen">
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  ms/call  ms/call  name
 10.02    231.22    72.43       46  1574.57  1574.57  strcspn
  7.95    288.70    57.48      130   442.15   442.15  strncasematch
</pre><p>

The "seconds" columns are really CPU opcodes, 1/100 second per opcode.
So, "231.22" above means 23,122 opcodes.  The ms/call values are 10x
too big; 1574.57 means 157.457 opcodes per call.  Similar adjustments
need to be made for the "self" and "children" columns in the second
part of the report.
</p><p>
OK, so now we've got a huge report that took a long time to generate,
and we've identified a spot we want to work on optimizing.  Let's say
it's the time() function.  We can use SSP to selectively profile this
function by using OutputDebugString() to control SSP from within the
program.  Here's a sample program:

</p><pre class="screen">
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
	main()
	{
	  time_t t;
	  OutputDebugString("ssp on");
	  time(&amp;t);
	  OutputDebugString("ssp off");
	}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Then, add the <code class="literal">-d</code> option to ssp to default to 
*disabling* profiling.  The program will run at full speed until the first 
OutputDebugString, then step until the second.
You can then use <span><strong class="command">gprof</strong></span> (as usual) to see the performance 
profile for just that portion of the program's execution.
</p><p>
There are many options to ssp.  Since step-profiling makes your
program run about 1,000 times slower than normal, it's best to
understand all the options so that you can narrow down the parts
of your program you need to single-step.
</p><p>
<code class="literal">-v</code> - verbose.  This prints messages about threads 
starting and stopping, OutputDebugString calls, DLLs loading, etc.
</p><p>
<code class="literal">-t</code> and <code class="literal">-c</code> - tracing.  
With <code class="literal">-t</code>, *every* step's address is written
to the file "trace.ssp".  This can be used to help debug functions,
since it can trace multiple threads.  Clever use of scripts can match
addresses with disassembled opcodes if needed.  Warning: creates
*huge* files, very quickly.  <code class="literal">-c</code> prints each address to 
the console, useful for debugging key chunks of assembler.  Use 
<code class="literal">addr2line -C -f -s -e foo.exe &lt; trace.ssp &gt; lines.ssp</code>
and then <code class="literal">perl cvttrace</code> to convert to symbolic traces.
</p><p>
<code class="literal">-s</code> - subthreads.  Usually, you only need to trace the 
main thread, but sometimes you need to trace all threads, so this enables that.
It's also needed when you want to profile a function that only a
subthread calls.  However, using OutputDebugString automatically
enables profiling on the thread that called it, not the main thread.
</p><p>
<code class="literal">-l</code> - dll profiling.  Generates a pretty table of how much 
time was spent in each dll the program used.  No sense optimizing a function in
your program if most of the time is spent in the DLL.
I usually use the <code class="literal">-v</code>, <code class="literal">-s</code>, and 
<code class="literal">-l</code> options:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp <code class="literal">-v</code> <code class="literal">-s</code> <code class="literal">-l</code> <code class="literal">-d</code> 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe

Cygwin is not a full operating system, and so must rely on Windows for
accomplishing some tasks. For example, Cygwin provides a POSIX view
of the Windows filesystem, but does not provide filesystem drivers of 
its own. Therefore part of using Cygwin effectively is learning to use
Windows effectively. 
Many Windows utilities provide a good way to interact with Cygwin's 
predominately command-line environment. For example, 
<span><strong class="command">ipconfig.exe</strong></span> provides information about network 
configuration, and <span><strong class="command">net.exe</strong></span> views and configures
network file and printer resources.  Most of these tools
support the <code class="literal">/?</code> switch to display usage information. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, no standard set of tools included with all versions of 
Windows exists.  If you are unfamiliar with the tools available 
on your system, here is a general guide.  Windows NT 4.0 has only a basic 
set of tools, which later versions of Windows expanded. 
Microsoft also provides free downloads for Windows NT 4.0 (the Resource Kit 
Support Tools), Windows 2000 (the Resource Kit Tools), and XP (the 
Windows Support Tools).  Generally, the younger the Windows version, the
more complete are the on-board tools.  Additionally, many independent sites
such as 
<a href="http://download.com" target="_top">download.com</a>, 
<a href="http://simtel.net" target="_top">simtel.net</a>, 
and Microsoft's own
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx" target="_top">Sysinternals</a>
provide quite useful command-line utilities, as far as they are not
already provided by Cygwin.  A few Windows tools, such as 
<span><strong class="command">find.exe</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">link.exe</strong></span> and
<span><strong class="command">sort.exe</strong></span>, may conflict with the Cygwin versions
make sure that you use the full path (<span><strong class="command">/usr/bin/find</strong></span>)
or that your Cygwin <code class="literal">bin</code> directory comes first in your
<code class="envar">PATH</code>.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-pathnames-effectively"></a>Pathnames</h3></div></div></div><p>
Windows programs do not understand POSIX pathnames, so any arguments 
that reference the filesystem must be in Windows (or DOS) format or 
translated.  Cygwin provides the <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> utility for 
converting between Windows and POSIX paths. A complete description of its 
options and examples of its usage are in <a href="#cygpath" title="cygpath">the section called &#8220;cygpath&#8221;</a>, 
including a shell script for starting Windows Explorer in any directory. 
The same format works for most Windows programs, for example 
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">notepad.exe "$(cygpath -aw "Desktop/Phone Numbers.txt")"</code>
</pre><p>
A few programs require a Windows-style, semicolon-delimited path list, 
which <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> can translate from a POSIX path with the
<code class="literal">-p</code> option. For example, a Java compilation from 
<span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> might look like this: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">javac -cp "$(cygpath -pw "$CLASSPATH")" hello.java</code>
</pre><p>
Since using quoting and subshells is somewhat awkward, it is often 
preferable to use <span><strong class="command">cygpath</strong></span> in shell scripts.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-console"></a>Console Programs</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another issue is receiving output from or giving input to console-based 
Windows programs.  Unfortunately, interacting with Windows console 
applications is not a simple matter of using a translation utility. Windows 
console applications are designed to run under 
<span><strong class="command">cmd.exe</strong></span>, and some do not deal gracefully with other
situations.  Cygwin can receive console input only if it
is also running in a console window since Windows does not provide
any way to attach to the backend of the console device. Another
traditional Unix input/output method, ptys (pseudo-terminals), is
supported by Cygwin but not entirely by Windows.  The basic problem is 
that a Cygwin pty is a pipe and some Windows applications do not like 
having their input or output redirected to pipes.  
</p><p>
To help deal with these issues, Cygwin supports customizable levels of 
Windows versus Unix compatibility behavior.  To be most compatible with 
Windows programs, use a DOS prompt, running only the occasional Cygwin 
command or script. Next would be to run <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> within 
a default DOS box. To make Cygwin more Unix compatible in this case, 
set <code class="envar">CYGWIN=tty</code> (see <a href="#using-cygwinenv" title="The CYGWIN environment
variable">the section called &#8220;The <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> environment
variable&#8221;</a>).
Alternatively, the optional <code class="systemitem">rxvt</code> package provides 
a native-Windows version of the popular X11 terminal emulator (it is not 
necessary to set <code class="envar">CYGWIN=tty</code> with <span><strong class="command">rxvt</strong></span>). 
Using <span><strong class="command">rxvt.exe</strong></span> provides the most Unix-like environment, 
but expect some compatibility problems with Windows programs.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-net"></a>Cygwin and Windows Networking</h3></div></div></div><p>
Many popular Cygwin packages, such as <code class="systemitem">ncftp</code>, 
<code class="systemitem">lynx</code>, and <code class="systemitem">wget</code>, require a 
network connection.  Since Cygwin relies on Windows for connectivity, 
if one of these tools is not working as expected you may need to 
troubleshoot using Windows tools. The first test is to see if you
can reach the URL's host with <span><strong class="command">ping.exe</strong></span>, one of the 
few utilities included with every Windows version since Windows 95.
If you chose to install the <code class="systemitem">inetutils</code> package, 
you may have both
Windows and Cygwin versions of utilities such as <span><strong class="command">ftp</strong></span>
and <span><strong class="command">telnet</strong></span>. If you are having problems using one
of these programs, see if the alternate one works as expected. 
</p><p>
There are a variety of other programs available for specific situations.
If your system does not have an always-on network connection, you 
may be interested in <span><strong class="command">rasdial.exe</strong></span> for automating dialup
connections.  
Users who frequently change their network 
configuration can script these changes with <span><strong class="command">netsh.exe</strong></span> 
(Windows 2000 and later). For proxy users, the open source 
<a href="http://apserver.sourceforge.net" target="_top">
NTLM Authorization Proxy Server</a> or the no-charge
<a href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html" target="_top">
Hummingbird SOCKS Proxy</a> may allow you to use Cygwin network
programs in your environment.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-cygutils"></a>The cygutils package</h3></div></div></div><p>
The optional <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> package contains
miscellaneous tools that are small enough to not require their own package.
It is not included in a default Cygwin install; select it from the Utils
category in <span><strong class="command">setup.exe</strong></span>. Several of the
<code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> tools are useful for interacting with
Windows.</p><p>
One of the hassles of Unix-Windows interoperability is the different line 
endings on text files.  As mentioned in <a href="#using-textbinary" title="Text and Binary modes">the section called &#8220;Text and Binary modes&#8221;</a>, 
Unix tools such as <span><strong class="command">tr</strong></span> can convert between CRLF and LF 
endings, but <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> provides several dedicated programs: 
<span><strong class="command">conv</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">d2u</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">dos2unix</strong></span>, 
<span><strong class="command">u2d</strong></span>, and <span><strong class="command">unix2dos</strong></span>. Use the
<code class="literal">--help</code> switch for usage information. 
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-shortcuts"></a>Creating shortcuts with cygutils</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another problem area is between Unix-style links, which link one file
to another, and Microsoft .lnk files, which provide a shortcut to a
file.  They seem similar at first glance but, in reality, are fairly 
different.  By default, Cygwin uses a mechanism that creates symbolic
links that are compatible with standard Microsoft .lnk files. However,
they do not include much of the information that is available in a 
standard Microsoft shortcut, such as the working directory, an icon, 
etc.  The <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> package includes a 
<span><strong class="command">mkshortcut</strong></span> 
utility for creating standard Microsoft .lnk files.
</p><p>
If Cygwin handled these native shortcuts like any other symlink, 
you could not archive Microsoft .lnk files into <span><strong class="command">tar</strong></span>
archives and keep all the information in them.  After unpacking, 
these shortcuts would have lost all the extra information and would
be no different than standard Cygwin symlinks. Therefore these two types 
of links are treated differently.  Unfortunately, this means that the 
usual Unix way of creating and using symlinks does not work with 
Windows shortcuts. 
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-printing"></a>Printing with cygutils</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are several options for printing from Cygwin, including the 
<span><strong class="command">lpr</strong></span> found in <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> (not to be confused with the 
native Windows <span><strong class="command">lpr.exe</strong></span>). The easiest way to use <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code>' 
<span><strong class="command">lpr</strong></span> is to specify a default device name in the 
<code class="envar">PRINTER</code> environment variable.  You may also specify a device 
on the command line with the <code class="literal">-d</code> or <code class="literal">-P</code> 
options, which will override the environment variable setting. 
</p><p>
A device name 
may be a UNC path (<code class="literal">\\server_name\printer_name</code>), a reserved 
DOS device name (<code class="literal">prn</code>, <code class="literal">lpt1</code>), or a 
local port name that is mapped to a printer share. Note that forward slashes 
may be used in a UNC path (<code class="literal">//server_name/printer_name</code>),
which is helpful when using <span><strong class="command">lpr</strong></span> from a shell that uses
the backslash as an escape character. 
</p><p>
<span><strong class="command">lpr</strong></span> sends raw data to the printer; no formatting is done.
Many, but not all, printers accept plain text as input. If your printer 
supports PostScript, packages such as 
<code class="systemitem">a2ps</code> and <code class="systemitem">enscript</code> can prepare 
text files for printing. The <code class="systemitem">ghostscript</code> package also 
provides some translation
from PostScript to various native printer languages. Additionally, a native 
Windows application for printing PostScript, <span><strong class="command">gsprint</strong></span>, is 
available from the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/" target="_top">Ghostscript
website</a>.

standard Windows 32-bit API, including the GUI functions as defined in
any Microsoft or off-the-shelf publication.  However, the process of
building those applications is slightly different, as you'll be using
the GNU tools instead of the Microsoft tools.</p><p>For the most part, your sources won't need to change at all.

myapp.exe : myapp.o myapp.res

myapp.res : myapp.rc resource.h
	windres $&lt; -O coff -o $@

</pre><p>Note the use of <code class="filename">windres</code> to compile the
Windows resources into a COFF-format <code class="filename">.res</code> file.
That will include all the bitmaps, icons, and other resources you
need, into one handy object file.  Normally, if you omitted the "-O
coff" it would create a Windows <code class="filename">.res</code> format file,
but we can only link COFF objects.  So, we tell
<code class="filename">windres</code> to produce a COFF object, but for
compatibility with the many examples that assume your linker can
handle Windows resource files directly, we maintain the
<code class="filename">.res</code> naming convention.  For more information on
<code class="filename">windres</code>, consult the Binutils manual.  </p><p>

it, meaning there's something wrong with the program itself that is
causing unexpected results or crashes.  Diagnosing these bugs and
fixing them is made easy by special tools called
<span class="emphasis"><em>debuggers</em></span>.  In the case of Cygwin, the debugger
is GDB, which stands for "GNU DeBugger".  This tool lets you run your
program in a controlled environment where you can investigate the
state of your program while it is running or after it crashes.
Crashing programs sometimes create "core" files. In Cygwin these are 
regular text files that cannot be used directly by GDB.
</p><p>Before you can debug your program, you need to prepare your
program for debugging.  What you need to do is add
<code class="literal">-g</code> to all the other flags you use when compiling
your sources to objects.</p><div class="example"><a name="gdb-g"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4.2. Compiling with -g</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">$</code> gcc -g -O2 -c myapp.c
<code class="prompt">$</code> gcc -g myapp.c -o myapp
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>What this does is add extra information to the objects (they get
much bigger too) that tell the debugger about line numbers, variable
names, and other useful things.  These extra symbols and debugging
information give your program enough information about the original
sources so that the debugger can make debugging much easier for
you.</p><p>In Windows versions of GNUPro, GDB comes with a full-featured
graphical interface.  In Cygwin Net distributions, GDB is only
available as a command-line tool.  To invoke GDB, simply type
<span><strong class="command">gdb myapp.exe</strong></span> at the command prompt.  It will
display some text telling you about itself, then
<code class="literal">(gdb)</code> will appear to prompt you to enter commands.
Whenever you see this prompt, it means that gdb is waiting for you to
type in a command, like <span><strong class="command">run</strong></span> or
<span><strong class="command">help</strong></span>.  Oh <code class="literal">:-)</code> type
<span><strong class="command">help</strong></span> to get help on the commands you can type in,
or read the [<span class="citation">GDB User's Manual</span>] for a complete
description of GDB and how to use it.</p><p>If your program crashes and you're trying to figure out why it
crashed, the best thing to do is type <span><strong class="command">run</strong></span> and let
your program run.  After it crashes, you can type
<span><strong class="command">where</strong></span> to find out where it crashed, or
<span><strong class="command">info locals</strong></span> to see the values of all the local
variables.  There's also a <span><strong class="command">print</strong></span> that lets you look
at individual variables or what pointers point to.</p><p>If your program is doing something unexpected, you can use the
<span><strong class="command">break</strong></span> command to tell gdb to stop your program when it
gets to a specific function or line number:</p><div class="example"><a name="gdb-break"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4.3. "break" in gdb</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">(gdb)</code> break my_function
<code class="prompt">(gdb)</code> break 47
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Now, when you type <span><strong class="command">run</strong></span> your program will stop
at that "breakpoint" and you can use the other gdb commands to look at
the state of your program at that point, modify variables, and
<span><strong class="command">step</strong></span> through your program's statements one at a
time.</p><p>Note that you may specify additional arguments to the
<span><strong class="command">run</strong></span> command to provide command-line arguments to
your program.  These two cases are the same as far as your program is

variables, etc.  All these are merged together, like if you were
building one big object files, and put into the dll.  They are not
put into your .exe at all.</p><p>The exports contains a list of functions and variables that the
dll makes available to other programs.  Think of this as the list of
"global" symbols, the rest being hidden.  Normally, you'd create this
list by hand with a text editor, but it's possible to do it
automatically from the list of functions in your code.  The
<code class="filename">dlltool</code> program creates the exports section of
the dll from your text file of exported symbols.</p><p>The import library is a regular UNIX-like
<code class="filename">.a</code> library, but it only contains the tiny bit of
information needed to tell the OS how your program interacts with
("imports") the dll.  This information is linked into your
<code class="filename">.exe</code>.  This is also generated by
<code class="filename">dlltool</code>.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dll-build"></a>Building DLLs</h3></div></div></div><p>This page gives only a few simple examples of gcc's DLL-building 
capabilities. To begin an exploration of the many additional options,
see the gcc documentation and website, currently at 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_top">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>
</p><p>Let's go through a simple example of how to build a dll.
For this example, we'll use a single file
<code class="filename">myprog.c</code> for the program
(<code class="filename">myprog.exe</code>) and a single file
<code class="filename">mydll.c</code> for the contents of the dll
(<code class="filename">mydll.dll</code>).</p><p>Fortunately, with the latest gcc and binutils the process for building a dll
is now pretty simple. Say you want to build this minimal function in mydll.c:</p><pre class="screen">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
hello()
{
  printf ("Hello World!\n");
}  
</pre><p>First compile mydll.c to object code:</p><pre class="screen">gcc -c mydll.c</pre><p>Then, tell gcc that it is building a shared library:</p><pre class="screen">gcc -shared -o mydll.dll mydll.o</pre><p>
That's it! To finish up the example, you can now link to the
dll with a simple program:
</p><pre class="screen">
int 
main ()
{
  hello ();
}  
</pre><p>
Then link to your dll with a command like:
</p><pre class="screen">gcc -o myprog myprog.c -L./ -lmydll</pre><p>However, if you are building a dll as an export library,
you will probably want to use the complete syntax:</p><pre class="screen">gcc -shared -o cyg${module}.dll \
    -Wl,--out-implib=lib${module}.dll.a \
    -Wl,--export-all-symbols \
    -Wl,--enable-auto-import \
    -Wl,--whole-archive ${old_libs} \
    -Wl,--no-whole-archive ${dependency_libs}</pre><p>
The name of your library is <code class="literal">${module}</code>, prefixed with
<code class="literal">cyg</code> for the DLL and <code class="literal">lib</code> for the
import library. Cygwin DLLs use the <code class="literal">cyg</code> prefix to 
differentiate them from native-Windows MinGW DLLs, see 
<a href="http://mingw.org" target="_top">the MinGW website</a> for more details.
<code class="literal">${old_libs}</code> are all
your object files, bundled together in static libs or single object
files and the <code class="literal">${dependency_libs}</code> are import libs you 
need to link against, e.g 
<strong class="userinput"><code>'-lpng -lz -L/usr/local/special -lmyspeciallib'</code></strong>.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dll-link"></a>Linking Against DLLs</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have an existing DLL already, you need to build a

the DLL, see <a href="#dll-build" title="Building DLLs">the section called &#8220;Building DLLs&#8221;</a> for details on having 
<code class="filename">gcc</code> build one for you.  If you do not have the
source or a supplied working import library, you can get most of
the way by creating a .def file with these commands (you might need to
do this in <code class="filename">bash</code> for the quoting to work
correctly):</p><pre class="screen">
echo EXPORTS &gt; foo.def
nm foo.dll | grep ' T _' | sed 's/.* T _//' &gt;&gt; foo.def
</pre><p>Note that this will only work if the DLL is not stripped.
Otherwise you will get an error message: "No symbols in
foo.dll".</p><p>Once you have the <code class="filename">.def</code> file, you can create
an import library from it like this:</p><pre class="screen">
