installer ``Cygwin Setup''.  It is flexible and easy to use.  
You can pick and choose the packages you wish to install, and update
them individually.  Full source code is available for all packages and
tools.  More information on using Cygwin Setup may be found at

</p><p>If you do it any other way, you're on your own!  That said, keep in mind
that the GUI installer is a "work in progress", so there might be a few
difficulties, especially if you are behind a firewall or have other
specific requirements.  If something doesn't work right for you, and
it's not covered here or in the latest development snapshot at

When you upgrade an existing older Cygwin installation to Cygwin 1.7, your old
system mount points (stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE branch of your registry)
are read by a script and the /etc/fstab file is generated from these entries. 
No such automatism exists for the user mount points formerly stored in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of the registry.  There's a bash script for your
convenience, which creates a user-specific /etc/fstab/${USER} file for you,
called /bin/copy-user-registry-fstab.  For more information on the new fstab
files see the User's Guide at

irritation of most users.  Now the default is to install only a basic
core of packages.  Cygwin Setup is designed to make it easy to browse
categories and select what you want to install or omit from those
categories.  It's also easy to install everything:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>At the ``Select Packages'' screen, in ``Categories'' view, at the line 
marked ``All'', click on the word ``default'' so that it changes to
``install''.  (Be patient, there is some computing to do at this step.
It may take a second or two to register the change.)  This tells Setup
to install <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>, not just what it thinks you should have
by default.
</p></li><li><p>Now click on the ``View'' button (twice) until you get the
``Partial'' view.  This shows exactly which packages are about to be
downloaded and installed.
</p></li></ol></div><p>This procedure only works for packages that are currently available.
There is no way to tell Cygwin Setup to install all packages by
default from now on.  As new packages become available that would not
be installed by default, you have to repeat the above procedure to get
them.
</p><p>In general, a better method (in my opinion), is to:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>First download &amp; install all packages that would normally be
installed by default.  This includes fundamental packages and any
updates to what you have already installed.  Then...
</p></li><li><p>Run Cygwin Setup again, and apply the above technique to get all
new packages that would not be installed by default.  You can check
the list in the Partial View before proceeding, in case there's
something you really <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> want.
</p></li><li><p>In the latest version of Cygwin Setup, if you click the ``View''
button (twice) more, it shows packages not currently installed.  You
ought to check whether you <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> want to install everything!

leaving parts of the application in a non-executable state.  Curious enough,
this only happens if DEP (Data Execution Prevention) is turned on for
all applications.</p><p>So far, only few Cygwin packages have their binaries marked as
TS-aware, which means there's a good chance that the postinstall scripts
during the installation will break, and that after installation you
can't start a shell, etc.</p><p>So, for the time being, here's how you install Cygwin on a Terminal
Server.  First, switch DEP to "Turn on DEP for essential Windows programs
and services only" and reboot the machine.  Then install via setup.exe.
You can leave it at that and run the Terminal Server in the aforementioned
DEP setting.  Or use the peflags tool from the rebase package to set
the TS-aware flag in all executables, switch DEP back to "Turn on DEP for
all programs and services except [...]" and reboot again.  However,
please keep in mind that a package update might re-install a binary
with the TS-aware flag switched off again.  So you will have to re-use
the peflags utility once in a while.

The recommended method to remove all 
of Cygwin is as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If you have any Cygwin services running, remove by repeating 
the instructions in <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.setup.html#faq.setup.uninstall-service" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.setup.html#faq.setup.uninstall-service</a> for
all services that you installed.  Common services that might have been
installed are <code class="literal">sshd</code>, <code class="literal">cron</code>, 
<code class="literal">cygserver</code>, <code class="literal">inetd</code>, <code class="literal">apache</code>, 
<code class="literal">postgresql</code>, and so on.
</p></li><li><p>Stop the X11 server if it is running, and terminate any Cygwin programs 
that might be running in the background.  Exit the command prompt and ensure
that no Cygwin processes remain.  Note: If you want to save your mount points for a later 
reinstall, first save the output of <code class="literal">mount -m</code> as described at 
<a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Delete the Cygwin root folder and all subfolders.  If you get an error 
that an object is in use, then ensure that you've stopped all services and 
closed all Cygwin programs.  If you get a 'Permission Denied' error then you 
will need to modify the permissions and/or ownership of the files or folders 
that are causing the error.  For example, sometimes files used by system 
services end up owned by the SYSTEM account and not writable by regular users.  
</p><p>The quickest way to delete the entire tree if you run into this problem is to 
change the ownership of all files and folders to your account.  To do this in 
Windows Explorer, right click on the root Cygwin folder, choose Properties, then 
the Security tab.  If you are using Windows XP Home or Simple File Sharing,
you will need to boot into Safe Mode to access the Security tab.  Select 
Advanced, then go to the Owner tab and make sure your account is listed as 
the owner.  Select the 'Replace owner on subcontainers and objects' checkbox 
and press Ok.  After Explorer applies the changes you should be able to 
delete the entire tree in one operation.  Note that you can also achieve 
this in Cygwin by typing <code class="literal">chown -R user /</code> or by using other 
tools such as <code class="literal">CACLS.EXE</code>. 
</p></li><li><p>Delete the Cygwin shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu, and anything 
left by setup.exe in the download directory.  However, if you plan to reinstall 
Cygwin it's a good idea to keep your setup.exe download directory since you can 
reinstall the packages left in its cache without redownloading them.
</p></li><li><p>If you added Cygwin to your system path, you should remove it unless you 
plan to reinstall Cygwin to the same location.  Similarly, if you set your 
CYGWIN environment variable system-wide and don't plan to reinstall, you should 
remove it.
</p></li><li><p>Finally, if you want to be thorough you can delete the registry tree 
<code class="literal">Software\Cygwin</code> under <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> and/or 
<code class="literal">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>.  However, if you followed the directions above you 
will have already removed everything important.  Typically only the installation
directory has been stored in the registry at all.

Snapshots are risky.  They
have not been tested.  Use them <span class="bold"><strong>only</strong></span> if there is a feature or
bugfix that you need to try, and you are willing to deal with any
problems, or at the request of a Cygwin developer.
</p><p>You should generally install the full
<code class="literal">cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2</code> update, rather than just the DLL,
otherwise some components may be out of sync.
</p><p>You cannot use Cygwin Setup to install a snapshot.
</p><p>First, you will need to download the snapshot from the snapshots
page at <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/snapshots/" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/snapshots/</a>.  Note the directory where
you saved the snapshot tarball.
</p><p>Before installing a snapshot, you must first Close <span class="bold"><strong>all</strong></span> Cygwin
applications, including shells and services (e.g., <code class="literal">inetd</code>, <code class="literal">sshd</code>).
You will not be able to replace <code class="literal">cygwin1.dll</code> if any Cygwin process is
running.  You may have to restart Windows to clear the DLL from memory
(beware of automatic service startup).
</p><p>Most of the downloaded snapshot can be installed using <code class="literal">tar</code>.  Cygwin
<code class="literal">tar</code> won't be able to update <code class="literal">/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll</code> (because it's
used by <code class="literal">tar</code> itself), but it should succeed with everything else.  If
you are only installing the DLL snapshot, skip the first tar command.  Open
a <code class="literal">bash</code> shell (it should be the only running Cygwin process) and issue
the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
	/bin/tar -C/ -jxvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 --exclude=usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
	/bin/tar -C/tmp -jxvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>
</p><p>Exit the bash shell, and use Explorer or the Windows command shell to
first rename <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> to
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</code> and then move
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\tmp\usr\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>
to <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> (assuming you installed Cygwin in
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin</code>).
</p><p>The operative word in trying the snapshots is "<span class="emphasis"><em>trying</em></span>".  If you
notice a problem with the snapshot that was not present in the release
DLL (what we call a "regression"), please report it to the Cygwin
mailing list (see <a class="ulink" href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html" target="_top">http://cygwin.com/problems.html</a> for problem
reporting guidelines).  If you wish to go back to the older version of the
DLL, again, close all Cygwin processes, delete
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>, and
rename <code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</code> back to
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code> (again assuming that your "<code class="literal">/</code>" is
<code class="literal">C:\cygwin</code>).  To restore the rest of the snapshot
files, reinstall the "<code class="literal">cygwin</code>" package using Setup.
