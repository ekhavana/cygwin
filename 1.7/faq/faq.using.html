package which provides the missing DLL package.
</p><p>If you already installed the package at one point, Cygwin Setup won't
show the option to install the package by default.  In the
``Select packages to install'' dialog, click on the <code class="literal">Full/Part</code>
button.  This lists all packages, even those that are already
installed.  Scroll down to locate the missing package, for instance
<code class="literal">libncurses8</code>.  Click on the ``cycle'' glyph until it says
``Reinstall''.  Continue with the installation.

it to other missing DLLs and identify their containing packages, see

</p><p>Cygwin is also capable to create POSIX symlinks as Windows shortcuts 
(see the CYGWIN environment variable option "winsymlinks"), but these
shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native Windows
applications.  Windows applications can usually make use of Cygwin
shortcuts but not vice versa.  This is by choice.  The reason is that
Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which would
get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts them as
symlinks.

shortcut into a Windows native shortcut.  Afterwards, Cygwin will not
recognize it as symlink anymore.

you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.
</p><p>If the path argument to find, including current directory (default), is
itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it unless you
specify the <code class="literal">-follow</code> option.  This behavior is different than most
other UNIX implementations, but is not likely to change.
</p><p>If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to be
missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem with one
of find's optimisations.  The absence of <code class="literal">.</code> and <code class="literal">..</code>
directories on some filesystems, such as DVD-R UDF, can confuse find.

that your script is executable.  On NTFS or NFS just make the script
executable using <code class="literal">chmod +x</code>.  However,
<code class="literal">chmod</code> may not work due to restrictions of the
filesystem (see FAQ entry above).  In this case Cygwin must read the
contents of files to determine if they are executable.  If your script
does not start with
</p><pre class="screen">

under the mount point as executable.  This can be used for individual
files as well as directories.  Then Cygwin will not bother to read files

Actually, if you are very careful, you can have two different versions
of the Cygwin DLL installed on your system at the same time but they
must be run serially.  The only exception from this rule is, if one of
the DLLs is a pre-1.7 DLL and the other is a 1.7.0 or later DLL.  These
DLLs can work concurrently without knowing about each other due to
massive changes using shared resources in Cygwin 1.7.  However,
processes using different DLLs will not interact with each other
correctly, so keep them separate except you really really know what
you're doing.
</p><p>This usage is not recommeded for novices.  Only limited support will be

But doesn't that mean that if some application installs an older Cygwin
DLL on top of a newer DLL, my application will break?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
It depends on what you mean by "break".  If the application installs a
version of the Cygwin DLL in another location than Cygwin's /bin
directory then the rules in
<a class="xref" href="faq.using.html#faq.using.third-party.multiple-copies" title="Question">Q:&#160;20</a> apply. 
If the application installs an older version of the DLL in /bin then you
should complain loudly to the application provider.
</p><p>
Remember that the Cygwin DLL strives to be backwards compatible so a
newer version of the DLL should always work with older executables.  So,
in general, it is always best to keep one version of the DLL on your
system and it should always be the latest version which matches your
installed distribution.

responsible for sending out updates of the package.  This person is a
volunteer who is rarely the same person as the official developer of the
package.  If you notice that a version of a package seems to be out of

the newer package actually requires complex changes that the maintainer
is working out.

</p><p>Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</p><p>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</pre><p>
and
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /
</pre><p>
for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.
</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Warning:</strong></span> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.
</p><p>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</pre><p>
Then <code class="literal">/cygdrive/c/Windows</code> becomes <code class="literal">/c/Windows</code> which is a
little less typing.
</p><p>Note that you have to enter the mount point into the
<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file to keep it indefinitely. 
The mount command will only add the mount point for the lifetime
of your current Cygwin session.
</p><p>You can change the default <code class="literal">cygdrive</code> prefix and whether it is binmode or textmode using the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file
as well.  See the Cygwin User's Guide at

connection-related problems, disabling the firewall is a good
troubleshooting step (as is closing or disabling all other running

</p><p>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is used.  The few rare
exceptions have to do with socket code.
Cygwin uses sockets to implement many of its functions, such as IPC.
Some overzealous firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock
stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
throughout.  Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with examples
of poorly written firewall-type software that causes things to break.
Note that with many of these products, simply disabling the firewall
does not remove these changes; it must be completely uninstalled.

/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> know what you are doing.
</p><p>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.
</p><p>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.
</p><p>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <span class="emphasis"><em>So don't do this!</em></span>
</p><p>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.

things you might add in the future?)

Cygwin and Cygwin packages that seem to have no rational explanation.  Among
the most common symptoms they report are fork failures, memory leaks, and file
access denied problems.  These problems, when they have been traced, often appear
to be caused by interference from other software installed on the same PC.  Security
software, in particular, such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall applications,
often implements its functions by installing hooks into various parts of the system,
including both the Explorer shell and the underlying kernel.  Sometimes these hooks
are not implemented in an entirely transparent fashion, and cause changes in the
behaviour which affect the operation of other programs, such as Cygwin.
</p><p>Among the software that has been found to cause difficulties are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Sonic Solutions burning software containing DLA component (when DLA disabled)</p></li><li><p>Norton/MacAfee/Symantec antivirus or antispyware</p></li><li><p>Logitech webcam software with "Logitech process monitor" service</p></li><li><p>Kerio, Agnitum or ZoneAlarm Personal Firewall</p></li><li><p>Iolo System Mechanic/AntiVirus/Firewall</p></li><li><p>LanDesk</p></li><li><p>Windows Defender </p></li><li><p>Embassy Trust Suite fingerprint reader software wxvault.dll</p></li><li><p>NOD32 Antivirus</p></li><li><p>ByteMobile laptop optimization client</p></li><li><p>Earthlink Total-Access</p></li><li><p>Spybot S&amp;D TeaTimer</p></li><li><p>AR Soft RAM Disk</p></li><li><p>ATI Catalyst drivers</p></li><li><p>Windows LiveOneCare</p></li><li><p>Webroot Spy Sweeper with Antivirus</p></li><li><p>COMODO Firewall Pro</p></li><li><p>PC Tools Spyware Doctor</p></li><li><p>Avira AntiVir</p></li><li><p>Panda Internet Security</p></li><li><p>BitDefender</p></li><li><p>Google Desktop</p></li><li><p>Sophos Anti-Virus 7</p></li><li><p>Bufferzone from Trustware</p></li></ul></div><p>Sometimes these problems can be worked around, by temporarily or partially
disabling the offending software.  For instance, it may be possible to disable
on-access scanning in your antivirus, or configure it to ignore files under the
Cygwin installation root.  Often, unfortunately, this is not possible; even disabling
the software may not work, since many applications that hook the operating system
leave their hooks installed when disabled, and simply set them into what is intended
to be a completely transparent pass-through mode.  Sometimes this pass-through is not
as transparent as all that, and the hooks still interfere with Cygwin; in these cases,
it may be necessary to uninstall the software altogether to restore normal operation.
</p><p>Some of the symptoms you may experience are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Random fork() failures.</p><p>Caused by hook DLLs that load themselves into every process in the
system.  POSIX fork() semantics require that the memory map of the child process
must be an exact duplicate of the parent process' layout.  If one of these DLLs
loads itself at a different base address in the child's memory space as compared
to the address it was loaded at in the parent, it can end up taking the space that
belonged to a different DLL in the parent.  When Cygwin can't load the original
DLL at that same address in the child, the fork() call has to fail.
</p></li><li><p>File access problems.</p><p>Some programs (e.g., virus scanners with on-access scanning) scan or
otherwise operate on every file accessed by all the other software running on
your computer.  In some cases they may retain an open handle on the file even
after the software that is really using the file has closed it.  This has been
known to cause operations such as deletes, renames and moves to fail with
access denied errors.  In extreme cases it has been known for scanners to leak
file handles, leading to kernel memory starvation.
</p></li><li><p>Networking issues</p><p>Firewall software sometimes gets a bit funny about Cygwin.  It's not
currently understood why; Cygwin only uses the standard Winsock2 API, but
perhaps in some less-commonly used fashion that doesn't get as well tested
by the publishers of firewalls.  Symptoms include mysterious failures to
connect, or corruption of network data being sent or received.</p></li><li><p>Memory and/or handle leaks</p><p>Some applications that hook into the Windows operating system exhibit
bugs when interacting with Cygwin that cause them to leak allocated memory
or other system resources.  Symptoms include complaints about out-of-memory
errors and even virtual memory exhaustion dialog boxes from the O/S; it is
often possible to see the excess memory allocation using a tool such as
Task Manager or Sysinternals' Process Explorer, although interpreting the
statistics they present is not always straightforward owing to complications
such as virtual memory paging and file caching.</p></li></ul></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="faq.resources.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&#160;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="faq.api.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Further Resources&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="faq.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;Cygwin API Questions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
