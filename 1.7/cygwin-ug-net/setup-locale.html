Internationalization support is controlled by the <code class="envar">LANG</code> and
<code class="envar">LC_xxx</code> environment variables.  You can set all of them
but Cygwin itself only honors the variables <code class="envar">LC_ALL</code>,
<code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code>, and <code class="envar">LANG</code>, in this order, according
to the POSIX standard.  The content of these variables should follow the
POSIX standard for a locale specifier.  The correct form of a locale
specifier is</p><pre class="screen">
  language[[_TERRITORY][.charset][@modifier]]
</pre><p>"language" is a lowercase two character string per ISO 639-1,
"TERRITORY" is an uppercase two character string per ISO 3166, charset is
one of a list of supported character sets, and the modifier doesn't matter
here (though it might for some applications).  If you're interested in the
exact description, you can find it in the online publication of the POSIX
manual pages on the homepage of the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.opengroup.org/" target="_top">Open Group</a>.</p><p>Typical locale specifiers are</p><pre class="screen">
  "de_CH"	   language = German, territory = Switzerland, default charset
  "fr_FR.UTF-8"    language = french, territory = France, charset = UTF-8
  "ko_KR.eucKR"    language = korean, territory = South Korea, charset = eucKR
</pre><p>
And let's not forget the default locale called "C" or "POSIX"
which basically only supports plain ASCII code.  If the aforementioned
environment variables are not set, or set to "C" or "POSIX", you get the
default ASCII-only behaviour.
</p><p>
Right now the language and territory, as well as the modifier, are not
important to Cygwin, except to fix a single problem.  There's a class of
characters in the Unicode character set, called the "CJK Ambiguous Width
Character set".  For these characters the width returned by the
wcwidth/wcswidth function is usually 1.  This is often a problem in
East-Asian languages, which historically use character sets in which
these characters have a width of 2.  Kind of explains why they are
called "ambiguous"...</p><p>
The problem has been fixed for now like this.  wcwidth/wcswidth usually
return 1 as the width of these characters.  However, if the language is
specifed as "ja" (Japanese), "ko" (Korean), or "zh" (Chinese), wcwidth
returns 2 for these characters.  Unfortunately this isn't correct in
all circumstances, so the user can specify the modifier "@cjknarrow",
which modifies the behaviour of wcwidth/wcswidth to return 1 for the
ambiguous width characters to return 1 even in those languages.</p><p>
Other than that, the only important part so far is the character set.
How does that work?</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-locale-how"></a>How to set the locale</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
The default locale is the "C" or "POSIX" locale.  In this locale, basically
only ASCII characters are supported.  Even if one of the aforementioned
environment variables are set to something else, it's the application's
responsibility to call the function <code class="function">setlocale</code>,
typically like this</p><pre class="screen">
  setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
</pre><p>to switch to another locale according to the settings of the
internationalization environment variables.
</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
Assume that you've set one of the aforementioned environment variables to some
valid POSIX locale value, other than "C" and "POSIX", and assume that you
call an application which calls <code class="function">setlocale</code> as above.</p><p>Assume further that you're living in Japan.  You might want to use
the language code "ja" and the territory "JP", thus setting, say,
<code class="envar">LANG</code> to "ja_JP".  You didn't set a character set, so
what will Cygwin use now?  Easy!  It will use the default Windows ANSI
codepage of your system, if it's supported by Cygwin.  Hopefully Cygwin
supports all relevant default ANSI codepages...</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>For a list of supported character sets, see
<a class="xref" href="setup-locale.html#setup-locale-charsetlist" title="List of supported character sets">the section called &#8220;List of supported character sets&#8221;</a>
</p></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
You don't want to use the default Windows codepage as character set?
In that case you have to specify the charset explicitly.  For instance,
assume you're from Italy and don't want to use the default Windows codepage
1252, but the more portable ISO-8859-15 character set.  What you can do is
to set the <code class="envar">LANG</code> variable in the
<code class="filename">C:\cygwin\Cygwin.bat</code> file which is the batch file
to start a Cygwin session from the "Cygwin" desktop shortcut.</p><pre class="screen">
  @echo off

  C:
  chdir C:\cygwin\bin
  set LANG=it_IT.ISO-8859-15
  bash --login -i
</pre></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
Most singlebyte or doublebyte charsets have a disadvantage.  Windows
filesystems use the Unicode character set in the UTF-16 encoding to store filename information.  Not all characters
from the Unicode character set are available in a singlebyte or doublebyte
charset.  While Cygwin has a workaround to access files with unusual
characters (see <a class="xref" href="using-specialnames.html#pathnames-unusual" title="Filenames with unusual (foreign) characters">the section called &#8220;Filenames with unusual (foreign) characters&#8221;</a>), a better
workaround is to use always the UTF-8 character set.  UTF-8 is the only
multibyte character set which can represent <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span>
Unicode character.</p><pre class="screen">
  set LANG=es_MX.UTF-8
</pre><p>For a description of the Unicode standard, see the homepage of the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.unicode.org/" target="_top">Unicode Consortium</a>.

You can set the above internationalization variables not only in
<code class="filename">Cygwin.bat</code> or in the Windows environment, but also
in your Cygwin shell on the fly, even switch to yet another character
set, and yet another.  In bash for instance:</p><pre class="screen">
  <code class="prompt">bash$</code> export LC_CTYPE="nl_BE.UTF-8"
</pre><p>However, here's a problem.  At the start of the first Cygwin process
in a session, the Windows environment has to be converted from UTF-16 to
some singlebyte or multibyte charset.  If the internationalization environment
variable hasn't been set <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> starting this process,
Cygwin has to make an educated guess which charset to use to convert
the environment itself.  The only reproducible way to do that in the absence
of <code class="envar">LC_ALL</code>, <code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code>, or <code class="envar">LANG</code>,
is to use the "C" locale.  The default conversion in the "C" locale
used by Cygwin internally is UTF-8.  So, in the absence of any
internationalization environment variable, the environment will be converted
to UTF-8.</p><p>As long as the environment only contains ASCII characters, this is
no problem at all.  But if it contains native characters, and you're planning
to use, say, GBK, the environment will result in invalid characters in
the GBK charset.  This would be especially a problem in variables like
<code class="envar">PATH</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Per POSIX, the name of an environment variable should only
consist of valid ASCII characters, and only of uppercase letters, digits, and
the underscore for maximum portablilty.</p></div><p>Symbolic links, too, may pose a problem when switching charsets on
the fly.  A symbolic link contains the filename of the target file the
symlink points to.  When a symlink had been created with older versions
of Cygwin, the current ANSI or OEM character set had been used to store
the target filename, dependent on the old <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code>
environment variable setting <code class="envar">codepage</code> (see <a class="xref" href="using-cygwinenv.html#cygwinenv-removed-options" title="Obsolete options">the section called &#8220;Obsolete options&#8221;</a>.  If the target filename
contains non-ASCII characters and you use another character set than
your default ANSI/OEM charset, the target filename of the symlink is now
potentially an invalid character sequence in the new character set.
This behaviour is not different from the behaviour in other Operating
Systems.  So, if you suddenly can't access a symlink anymore which
worked all these years before, maybe it's because you switched to
another character set.  This doesn't occur with symlinks created with
Cygwin 1.7 or later.  </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-locale-missing"></a>What does not work?</h3></div></div></div><p>
Except for <code class="envar">LC_ALL</code>, <code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code>,
and <code class="envar">LANG</code>, all other LC_xxx environment variables,
<code class="envar">LC_COLLATE</code>, <code class="envar">LC_MESSAGES</code>,
<code class="envar">LC_MONETARY</code>, <code class="envar">LC_NUMERIC</code>,
and <code class="envar">LC_TIME</code>, are ignored right now.  This means, while Cygwin
supports different character sets, it does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> support
real localization so far.  There's no support for locale-specific monetary
symbols, for a decimalpoint other than '.', no support for native time
formats, and no support for native language sorting orders.
</p><p>Cygwin's internationalization support is work in progress and we would
be glad for coding help in this area.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setup-locale-charsetlist"></a>List of supported character sets</h3></div></div></div><p>Last but not least, here's the list of currently supported character
sets.  The left-hand expression is the name of the charset, as you would use
it in the internationalization environment variables as outlined above.
Note that charset specifiers are case-insensitive.  <code class="literal">EUCJP</code>
is equivalent to <code class="literal">eucJP</code> or <code class="literal">eUcJp</code>.
Writing the charset in the exact case as given in the list below is a
good convention, though.
</p><p>The right-hand side is the number of the equivalent Windows
codepage as well as the Windows name of the codepage.  They are only
noted here for reference.  Don't try to use the bare codepage number or
the Windows name of the codepage as charset in locale specifiers, unless
they happen to be identical with the left-hand side.  Especially in case
of the "CPxxx" style charsets, always use them with the trailing "CP".</p><p>This works:</p><pre class="screen">
