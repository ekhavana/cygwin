<H1 align=center>Cygwin on a CD</H1>

<P>Red Hat is no longer offering Cygwin 1.0 on CD.  There are tentative
plans to offer a new Cygwin CD sometime in early 2001.  So far, however,
there are no definite plans.

<P>This page will be updated as plans are finalized or as new alternatives
become available.

<P>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
