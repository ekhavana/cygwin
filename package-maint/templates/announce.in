Subject: Update: @PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@-@PACKAGE_RELEASE@

I have updated the @PACKAGE_NAME@ package to @PACKAGE_VERSION@-@PACKAGE_RELEASE@.

@PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION@

[CHANGEME: The full list of what the submission contains. For example, condensed
ChangeLog entries for this version, or what you changed for this release. If
this is an announcement for a new package, this may be blank.]

To update your installation, click on the "Install Cygwin now" link on the
http://cygwin.com/ web page. This downloads setup.exe to your system. Then, run
setup and answer all of the questions.

To install @PACKAGE_NAME@ for the first time, choose "@PACKAGE_TARNAME@" from
the packages list, in the "@PACKAGE_CATEGORY@" category. If you already have
@PACKAGE_NAME@ installed, the update will be pre-selected.

Remember that some mirror sites may not have updated before this announcement is
made. If your usual mirror does not have the latest version of this package,
please be patient or select an alternate mirror.

If you have general questions or comments, please send them to
<@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@>. I would appreciate it if you would use this address
rather than emailing me directly.

Thanks.
