<h1 align="center">Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  In fact there are four:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a>: a list for discussion of 
      all things Cygwin-related (traffic usually consists of 15-40 
      messages/day)

  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a>: a list for 
      discussion of porting <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">Xfree86</a>
      to Cygwin.

  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list for those folks
      who want to avoid all the traffic.  (Note that mail sent to the
      moderated list is also sent to the discussion list so you should only
      need to be subscribed to one).

  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL and the other components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.
      <p>Please only join if you intend
      to contribute code to Cygwin.  Subscription requests are handled on a
      case-by-case basis.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
</ul>

<p>You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from any of these lists by using
the form below.  <tt>cygwin-developers</tt> is a by-approval only list;
even though you send in a subscription request, it may not be approved.

<p>If you have <b>any</b> questions or problems with the mailing lists,
see the <a href="/ml/#faqs"><b>Sourceware mailing list FAQs</b></a>.


<P>Before you send any mail to one of these lists, you need to read
the relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the <a
href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, and the 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list archives</a>
so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or report
a bug that has aleady been reported.

<P>We try to actively reduce the amount of spam sent to the lists
by using the MAPS and ORBS relay blocking lists.  If your mail server
relays mail, note that it may be listed in one of these servers and
you will not be able to send mail to sourceware.cygnus.com.  Should
that be the case, contact your mail admin about fixing your mail
system.

<P>Questions or problems with the mailing lists should be directed to
<a href="mailto:postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com">postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.
