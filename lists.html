<h1>Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>
</center>

<p>Yes.  In fact there are three:

<ul>
<li><b>gnu-win32</b>: a list for discussion of all things
Cygwin-related (traffic usually consists of 15-40 messages/day)
<li><b>gnu-win32-announce</b>: a moderated announcement list for those folks
who want to avoid all the traffic.  (Note that mail sent to the
moderated list is also sent to the discussion list so you should only
need to be subscribed to one).
<li><b>cygwin32-developers</b>: a developers list for discussing the
internals of the Cygwin library.  Please only join if you intend
to contribute code to Cygwin.
</ul>
<P>

To subscribe to the main list, send a message to
<a href="mailto:gnu-win32-request@cygnus.com">gnu-win32-request@cygnus.com</a>
with a message body of
<blockquote>
        subscribe gnu-win32
</blockquote>
<P>

To join the announcement list, send a message to
<a href="mailto:gnu-win32-announce-request@cygnus.com">gnu-win32-announce-request@cygnus.com</a>
with a message body of
<blockquote>
        subscribe gnu-win32-announce
</blockquote>
<P>

The same method can be used to join the cygwin32-developers list.  <P>

To get more information about the mailing lists or the list server
(including info on how to unsubscribe from either list), send a
message to "gnu-win32-request@cygnus.com" with one line of text: "help".
Note that following a successful unsubscribe, you may still receive
mail from the list for a day or two because it can often take that
long for the mail queue to empty. <P>

Before you send any mail to the list, you need to read the
relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the
<a href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/gnu-win32">mailing list archives</a>
so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or
report a bug that has aleady been reported.
