<h1 align="center">Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a>: a list for discussion of 
      all things Cygwin-related.  If you have questions about how to use Cygwin, or
      any of its tools (bash, gcc, make, etc.), <b>this is the list for you</b>.
      HTML mail is <b>NOT PERMITTED</b> on this list and will be stripped.
      <br>(traffic usually consists of 15-40 messages/day)
  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list for those folks who want to avoid all the
      traffic.<br>
      Note that announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are automatically sent to
      the cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to subscribe to both mailing
      lists.

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and the other components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.  Subscription requests are
      handled on a case-by-case basis.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
      <b>Please do not join the cygwin-developers mailing list unless 1) you are thoroughly
      familiar with the cygwin DLL, 2) you have successfully built the DLL from source, and 3) you intend
      to contribute source code to Cygwin.</b>

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and the other components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of
      supplied patches are also acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit
      email to this list.

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a>: a 
      by-approval developers list for <b>discussing issues regarding applications
      that use the Cygwin DLL</b>.  If you are maintaining one of the packages that
      is distributed with the Cygwin net releases you should be subscribed to this list.
      Only subscribers may submit email to this list.

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a>: a list for 
      discussion of porting <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">Xfree86</a>
      to Cygwin.

  <p><li><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a>: a list which receives log messages
      for every CVS commit in the 'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then
      you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to diffs
      of the changes.
</ul>

<p>You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from any of the above lists by sending email to <b>themailinglistname-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com</b> or <b>themailinglistname-unsubscribe@sourceware.cygus.com</b> respectively.</p>

<p>If you have <b>any</b> questions or problems with the mailing lists,
see the <a href="/ml/#faqs"><b>Sourceware mailing list FAQs</b></a>.


<P>Before you send any mail to one of these lists, you need to read
the relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the <a
href="faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, and the 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list archives</a>
so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or report
a bug that has aleady been reported.

<P>We try to actively reduce the amount of spam sent to the lists
by using the MAPS and ORBS relay blocking lists.  If your mail server
relays mail, note that it may be listed in one of these servers and
you will not be able to send mail to sourceware.cygnus.com.  Should
that be the case, contact your mail admin about fixing your mail
system.

<P>Questions or problems with the mailing lists should be directed to
<a href="mailto:postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com">postmaster@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.
