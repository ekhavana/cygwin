<h1>Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several.  They are listed below.</p>
<p>However, please check out the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, the
<a href="cygwin-ug-net.html">documentation</a>,
and the <a href="problems.html">problem reporting guidelines</a> before
sending email to a mailing list.</p>

<a name="see-above"><h2>I have a question!  Should I just send it to one of the mailing lists below?</h2></a>
<b class="rbottom"><b class="r4"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r1"></b></b>
</div><br>

<p>That depends.  Have you researched your question already?  Cygwin is not
a new project.  It has been around for many years.  That means that almost any
question has probably already been asked.  Places to check for information
would be the <a href="faq.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>, the
<a href="docs.html">Cygwin documentation</a>, the
<a href="https://google.com/">web</a>, and the mailing list archives (click
on a mailing list name <a href="#available-lists">below</a> to search
the archive).</p>

<p>Now that you searched the information sources and came up blank, let us say
that there are a lot of friendly folk who will probably try to answer your
questions.  However, if you are going to ask a question, you should make sure
that you ask in a way which allows the folks on the list to answer your
question <a href="problems.html"><b>most easily</b></a>.  Vague, content-free,
or repetitive queries or observations are not overly likely to get an
answer.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a name="cygwin"><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a></a>:
  <b>In general, you should send questions and bug reports here.</b>  This is
  the list for <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of just about all things
  related to the Cygwin community release.  If you have questions about how to
  use Cygwin, or if you have <em>Cygwin-specific</em>
  (<a href="#see-above">see above</a>) questions,
  <a href="problems.html">problems</a>, or observations about the UNIX tools
  (bash, gcc, make, etc.) that come with Cygwin, this is the list for you
  (although it's very possible that you will receive more qualified help for
  such tools on their specific non-Cygwin mailing lists).  There are
  <b>a few exceptions</b> to the "all things Cygwin" nature of this list:
      <br><br><ul>
      <li>Patches <em>for the Cygwin DLL</em> should go to the cygwin-patches
      mailing list (see below).</li>
      <li>New package submissions should go to the cygwin-apps mailing list
      (see below).</li>
      <li>Questions about other Cygwin releases not downloaded from
      <a href="https://cygwin.com/">the Cygwin website</a> or its mirrors are
      strongly discouraged.  In theory, there should be better forums for
      discussing this kind of unsponsored software than the Cygwin mailing list.
      <br><em>This caveat applies to all of the mailing lists at this site.</em></li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-announce"><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a></a>:
  a moderated announcement list solely for announcements related to the
  official Cygwin release.  Announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are
  automatically sent to the Cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to
  subscribe to both mailing lists if your only intent is to be up-to-date
  on new package releases.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-apps"><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a></a>:
  a subscriber-only list for <em>package maintainers</em>  to discuss
  <a href="setup.html">packaging</a> issues regarding applications that are
  distributed with the Cygwin DLL</b>.  <b>Do not subscribe if you are not
  interested in being a package maintainer.</b> If you are maintaining or
  volunteering to maintain one of the packages that is distributed with the
  Cygwin net releases you should be subscribed to this list.  This list is
  intended for discussing solutions.  It is <b>not</b> for
  <em>bug reports</em>, <em>"it would be nice"</em>, or <em>"how do I"</em>
  type of musings.  Do not subscribe to this mailing list to ask questions
  about packages.  Use the main Cygwin mailing list for that.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-developers"><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a></a>:
  a subscribers-only list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin DLL</b>
  and all cygwin components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussion of upcoming
  net releases is also appropriate.  Please do not subscribe or send email to
  this list if you do not understand what is meant by "the winsup directory".
  <br><br>If you are interested in <a href="contrib.html">contributing</a> to
  the development of Cygwin, this is the place to discuss your plans.
  If you have an issue and hope that someone will look into it for you then
  please do not send email here.  This is a mailing list for doers not musers.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-patches"><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a></a>:
  a list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL</b> and the other
  components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of supplied patches are
  also acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-cvs"><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a></a>:
  a read-only list which receives log messages for every Git commit in the
  'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then you probably
  shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to
  diffs of the changes.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-apps-cvs"><a href="/ml/cygwin-apps-cvs/"><b>cygwin-apps-cvs</b></a></a>:
  a list which receives log messages for every Git and (back in the days) CVS
  commit in the 'cygwin-apps' repository.  If you don't know what this means
  then you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message
  and pointers to diffs of the changes.

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-talk"><a href="/ml/cygwin-talk/"><b>cygwin-talk</b></a></a>:
  a chatter list for discussing things that are tangentially related to Cygwin. 
  This list is intended to be funny but not terribly helpful.  <b>Do
  <em>not</em> send technical questions about Cygwin here.</b> Responses to
  technical questions in this list are not guaranteed to be serious or
  definitive, probably the opposite.  No profanity, no commercial posts, and
  minimal flaming, please.</li>

<P>Before you send any mail to one of these lists, you need to read
the relevant Cygwin documentation, especially the <a href="faq.html">Cygwin FAQ</a>,
and the <a href="https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/">mailing list archives</a>
so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or report
a bug that has already been reported.
