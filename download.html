<h1 align=center>Downloading and Installing Cygwin</h1>

<p>There are three ways to install Cygwin.  You may manually download
the packages you want, let setup automatically download all the
packages it needs, or manually install each package.</p>

<p>In any case, you need to select a local <a
href="mirrors.html">mirror site</a> that you will be downloading the
files from.  Each mirror site should have a directory called "latest"
that contains the latest versions of each package.  In this "latest"
directory should be a file called<tt> README </tt> which you
<em>really</em> should read.  There's also a<tt> setup.exe
</tt>program and a subdirectory for each package (we did this to allow
for more frequent package updates). </p>

<p>If you want to let the setup program do the installation for you,
download the<tt> setup.exe </tt> program to your computer.  Do
<strong>not</strong> let your browser run it automatically!  Save this
file in an empty temporary directory.</p>

<p>If you want to manually select the packages, download them now,
putting them in the same empty temporary directory as the setup
program.</p>

<p>Open a command window (often called an "MS-DOS" window).  Use
the<tt> cd </tt> command to change to the directory where the setup
program is, and then run the setup program.  It will prompt you for
the rest.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the setup program, there is an additional
file called<tt> bootstrap.zip </tt> that has a few key programs you'll
need to unpack the tar.gz files.  If you need further help doing it
this way, you probably should be using the setup program<tt>
:-)</tt></p>
