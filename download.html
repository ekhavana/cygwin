<h1 align=center>Downloading and Installing Cygwin</h1>

<p>The easiest way to install Cygwin is to simply click on the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">Install Cygwin Now!</a> link on the
<a href="index.html">Cygwin home page</a>.  This will download the
setup.exe program to your computer.  When you run setup.exe you will be
asked a series of questions for installing Cygwin on your computer.  We
<em>highly</em> recommend this method for installing Cygwin.</p>

<p>The setup.exe program also allows you to download the Cygwin files to
a directory on your computer without installing them.  By copying this
download directory to other systems or putting it on a file server, you
can, at a later time, use setup.exe to install directly from your hard
disk.</p>

<p>Due to volume limitations, the Cygwin distribution is only available from
<a href="mirrors.html">mirror sites</a>.  You'll be prompted to choose one
of these during the setup.exe installation.</p>

<p>If you are adventurous (i.e., masochistic) you can also download the
Cygwin distribution via ftp or http via some other program than
setup.exe.  Currently, the distribution is located in two directories:
"latest" and "contrib".  That is subject to change at any time,
though.</p>

<p>The Cygwin distribution consists of standard UNIX .tar.gz or .tar.bz2
files.  Cygwin's tar + gzip + bzip2 programs can unpack these files,
just like their UNIX counterparts however you will probably find
yourself in a chicken/egg situation if you attempt this without Cygwin
installed on your system (see below).  Installing Cygwin using this
method is <em>not</em> recommended.</p>

<p>Note that you may be tempted to unpack the .tar.gz files with some
Windows program like WinZip.  This will not work reliably.  Cygwin's tar
files are not fully understood by WinZip.  Attempting to use WinZip to
unpack a distribution will likely result in a damaged Cygwin
installation.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the setup program, there is an additional
file called<tt> bootstrap.zip </tt> that has a few key programs you'll
need to unpack the tar.gz files.  If you need further help doing it
this way, you probably should be using the setup program. <tt>:-)</tt></p>
