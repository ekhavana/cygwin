<h1 align=center>Downloading and Installing Cygwin</h1>

<p>There are three ways to install Cygwin.  You may manually download
the packages you want, let setup automatically download all the
packages it needs, or manually install each package.</p>

<p>In any case, you need to select a local <a
href="mirrors.html">mirror site</a> that you will be downloading the
files from.  Each mirror site should have a directory called "latest"
that contains the latest versions of each package.  In this "latest"
directory should be a file called<tt> README </tt> which you
<em>really</em> should read.  There's also a<tt> setup.exe
</tt>program and a subdirectory for each package (we did this to allow
for more frequent package updates). </p>

<p>If you want to let the setup program do the installation for you,
download the<tt> <a href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> </tt> program to
your computer and run it, or you can just click on the<tt> <a
href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> </tt>link to run the setup program
automatically.  You can also click on the "Install Cygwin NOW" icon on
the home page.</p>

<p>If you want to manually select the packages, download them to your
local disk, putting them in an empty temporary directory.  Then,
download the setup.exe program to the same directory and run it from
there.  </p>

<p>If you don't want to use the setup program, there is an additional
file called<tt> bootstrap.zip </tt> that has a few key programs you'll
need to unpack the tar.gz files.  If you need further help doing it
this way, you probably should be using the setup program<tt>
:-)</tt></p>
