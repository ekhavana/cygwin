<h1 align=center>Downloading and Installing Cygwin</h1>

<p>The easiest way to install or update Cygwin is to simply click on the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">Install Cygwin Now!</a> link on
the <a href="index.html">Cygwin home page</a>.  This will download the
setup.exe program to your computer.  When you run setup.exe you will be
asked a series of questions for installing Cygwin on your computer.
Using setup.exe is the only supported method for installing Cygwin.</p>
<p>Due to volume limitations, the Cygwin distribution is only available from
<a href="mirrors.html">mirror sites</a>.  You'll be prompted to choose one
of these during the setup.exe installation.</p>

<p>Currently, the setup.exe program has three options for installing
files.  The first option "Install from Internet" is the default and
is the option that should be used in most cases.  Selecting this option
causes packages to be downloaded from a mirror site and then installed
on your computer.  The files remain in the download directory after
installation.</p>

<p>The other two available options essentially allow you to break up the
first option into two disparate steps.  Selecting "Download from
Internet" causes setup.exe to retrieve files from your selected mirror
site without actually installing them.  Selecting "Install from Local
Directory" causes setup.exe to scan the specified local directory for
packages to install for files to install.</p>

<p>Both "Install from Internet" and "Download from Internet" check for
the existence of package files in your download directory.  They will
not download the same file more than once if it already exists in the
download directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>If you are adventurous (i.e., masochistic) you can also download the
Cygwin distribution via ftp or http using some other program than
setup.exe.  If you do this, note that the distribution is currently
located in the "release" directory.  This is subject to change at any
time, though.</p>

<p>The Cygwin distribution consists of standard UNIX .tar.gz or .tar.bz2
files.  Cygwin's tar + gzip + bzip2 programs can unpack these files,
just like their UNIX counterparts however you will probably find
yourself in a chicken/egg situation if you attempt this without Cygwin
installed on your system (see below).  Installing Cygwin using this
method is <em>not</em> recommended.</p>

<p>Note that you may be tempted to unpack the .tar.gz files with some
Windows program like WinZip.  This will not work reliably.  Cygwin's tar
files are not fully understood by WinZip.  Attempting to use WinZip to
unpack a distribution will result in a damaged Cygwin installation.</p>
