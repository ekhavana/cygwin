<h1>Cygwin Package Contributor's Guide</h1>

<p>This document is intended for people who upload packages to sourceware.org,
  to be made available through the standard Cygwin setup program. This documents
  the syntax of the setup.hint file, the layout required for packages, and the
  related policies to ensure good behaviour from the setup program.
</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">Setup</a> depends on
  certain conventions being followed. If they are not followed, bad things may
  happen to the users of the setup program. Where a convention can be ignored,
  should circumstances warrant, this document will specify that. Setup has it's
  own <a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">homepage</a>. If you
  are interested in adding features to setup, you should consult the setup
  homepage.

  If you are interested in creating a local mirror with or without custom Cygwin
  packages, see
  the <a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-server.html">package
  server</a> page.
</p>

<p>The <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list is the correct place to discuss any package creation or maintenance issues. It is not a place for end user bug reports - direct those to the <tt>cygwin</tt> mailing list instead.</p>

<h2><a id="naming" name="naming">Package file naming scheme</a></h2>
<p>
  Use the upstream's version plus a release suffix (i.e. findutils 4.5.12
  becomes 4.5.12-1, 4.5.12-2, etc., until findutils 4.5.13 is packaged, which
  would be 4.5.13-1, etc). Some packages also use a YYYYMMDD format for their
  versions, e.g. terminfo-5.9-20140524-1.tar.xz. The first release of a package
  should have a -1 release suffix.
</p>

<p>A complete package currently consists of three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a binary tar file, named <tt>package-version-release.tar.xz</tt></li>
  <li>a source tar file, named <tt>package-version-release-src.tar.xz</tt></li>
  <li>a setup.hint file</li>
</ul>

<p>
e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
bash$ ls -1 release/boffo
boffo-1.0-1.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1-src.tar.xz
setup.hint
</pre>

<p>Binary tar files generally contain the executable files that will be
  installed on a user's system plus any auxiliary files needed by the
  package. See the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section
  below for more details on the contents of a binary tar file.
</p>

<p>Source tar files should contain the source files, patches and scripts needed
  to rebuild the package. While installing these files is optional, the
  inclusion of a source tar file is part of the totality that makes up a Cygwin
  package and so, these files are <em>not</em> optional. In some cases, there
  may be multiple packages generated from the same source; for instance, one
  might have a "boffo" package and its associated shared library in "libboffo7",
  where both are generated from the same source tar file. See
  the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section below for more
  details on the contents of a source tar file, and
  the <a href="#advanced_setup.hint">setup.hint</a> section for information on
  the "external-source:" option.
</p>

<p>
  Note that package files may be .bz2, .gzip or .xz compressed.  .gzip is
  deprecated and .xz is preferred for new package submissions.
</p>

<p>
  The version and release <b>must</b> start with a digit.
  The release <b>must not</b> contain a hyphen.
</p>

<p>
  Version and release sort according to the following rules:
  <ul>
    <li>Contiguous chunks of digits or non-digits are compared</li>
    <li>Non-digit chunks sort before digit chunks</li>
    <li>Digit chunks sort numerically and non-digit chunks sort lexicographically</li>
    <li>If all chunks are equal, the string with any suffix remaining is the greater</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  A package with a higher version is greater, regardless of the release.  When
  two packages have an identical version, the one with the higher release is
  greater.
</p>

<h2><a id="setup.hint" name="setup.hint"><tt>setup.hint</tt></a></h2>
<p>Each package must be submitted with a file called <tt>setup.hint</tt>. This file is used for information that cannot be inferred just from the context of the file name or package name. Lines in <tt>setup.hint</tt> will consist of one of the following:</p>
<pre>
# <i>comment</i>
sdesc: <i>"some text"</i>
ldesc: <i>"some text"</i>
skip:
curr: <i>version</i>
prev: <i>version</i>
test: <i>version</i>
category: <i>name1[ name2...]</i>
requires: <i>package[ package...]</i>
external-source: <i>package</i>
</pre>
<p align="center">
  <b>Note: Not all of the above setup.hint lines are required. Please read the
  description below for further details on how to construct a setup.hint
  file.</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use UTF-8 character encoding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lines that begin with '#' are comments and are ignored.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, and <tt>test</tt> lines indicate which
      versions of that package should be used. Use these settings <em>only</em>
      if you need to circumvent the normal version ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the highest version (and release) numbers are used for the
      current version of a package; the next highest (if any) is used for the
      previous version.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use of <tt>curr</tt> and <tt>prev</tt> is usually not required, given this
      version ordering. So, e.g. if you had previously
      released <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt> and now have a new <tt>boffo-1.0-1</tt>, the
      version ordering matches the default and there is no need to
      use <tt>curr</tt> or <tt>prev</tt>, as <tt>1.0-1</tt> is greater
      than <tt>0.9-1</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you had discovered a serious error in the <tt>boffo-1.0</tt>
      release, and then decided that you want to drop back
      to <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt>, you could include entries like this:
    </p>

<pre>
prev: 1.0-1
curr: 0.9-1
</pre>

    <p>
      This usage should be rare, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, you should trust setup to "do the right thing" -- with one
      exception. If you decide that you need to release a <i>test</i> version of
      your package, there is no way for setup to know that.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, you will have to put something like "<tt>test: 1.9-1</tt>" in your
      setup.hint file. This will cause setup to characterize the 1.9-1 version
      as a "test" package. With the current setup implementation, it will also
      mean that it will be overlooked by most people during installation. So,
      unless you have made arrangements to advertise your test release, this
      option should be used sparingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if <em>any</em> of the <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, or <tt>test</tt>
      options are used, they will short circuit <em>all</em> of the automatic
      version ordering. So, if you include a <tt>test</tt> option, and you have
      valid current and/or previous tar files, you <em>must</em>
      specify <tt>curr</tt> and/or <tt>prev</tt>. Otherwise, the <b>only</b>
      version that setup will display will be the <tt>test</tt> version.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if your setup.hint looks like this:
    </p>

<pre>
test: 1.9-1
</pre>

    <p>
      then setup will not offer the 0.9-1 or 1.0-1 versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want all of the versions included, you must do this:
    </p>

<pre>
prev: 0.9-1
curr: 1.0-1
test: 1.9-1
</pre>

    <p>
      Setup is currently unable to list more than three versions of each
      package. Therefore you should not keep more than three versions of each
      package around: The current version, the previous stable version, and,
      optionally, one test version. By keeping a previous stable version around,
      you isolate yourself (somewhat) from problems with partial mirrors. When
      you add a new "current" version, you can either keep the old "previous"
      version, or make the old current version the new previous version,
      depending on how stable they each were.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not required that your package have a <tt>test</tt> version. Use of
      a <tt>test</tt> version of a package is at the discretion of the package
      maintainer.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>skip</tt> line indicates that that package should not appear in
      setup. It is intended for directories that exist in the hierarchy that
      should not be considered.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <tt>sdesc</tt> is a mandatory field for setup.hint. Your
      package <em>must</em> contain this field. The <tt>sdesc</tt> field is
      required for correct operation of the setup program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <tt>sdesc</tt> is a one line description of the package, enclosed in
      double-quotes.  This is the information that will be displayed when
      installing packages via setup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the package name should <em>not</em> be part of the
      description, e.g. this is incorrect:
    </p>

<pre>
sdesc:      "boffo: A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>

    <p>
      This is correct:
    </p>

<pre>
sdesc:      "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <tt>ldesc</tt> is a more descriptive, multi-line description of the
      package, enclosed in double-quotes.  It is intended for future use. e.g.:
    </p>

<pre>
ldesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>

    <p>
      Note that there is currently no method for escaping double-quotes, so
       there is no way to represent a double-quote embedded in
       the <tt>ldesc</tt>.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>category</tt> line indicates the categories that this package
      belongs to. One package can belong to multiple categories. Multiple
      categories are separated by spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do not enclose multiple category names within quotation marks.

      As you can see, currently, all categories consist of only a single
      word. We don't anticipate that this will change anytime soon.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>requires</tt> line indicates the packages that this package relies
      on. If your package is dependent on a file provided by another package
      that other package should be included here. The requires field may be
      missing or empty if your package truly does not require any other package.
    </p>

    <p>
      A package can rely on multiple other packages. Hierarchical dependencies
      should work correctly, however, it is best to always include specific
      dependencies, i.e. don't drop '<tt>bar</tt>' from your dependency list if
      your package requires it, even if you are including '<tt>foo</tt>' which
      relies on '<tt>bar</tt>'.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, do not include package dependencies of <em>dependent</em>
      packages in your dependency list. If you think that another package has an
      incorrect dependency list, send email to cygwin-apps noting that fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiple packages are separated by spaces. Do not enclose multiple package
      names within quotation marks.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of a complete <i>release/boffo/setup.hint</i>:</p>
<pre>
category: Games Text
requires: libncurses6 cygwin
sdesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
ldesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>
<p>Notice that we didn't use the <tt>prev</tt>, <tt>curr</tt> or <tt>test</tt> options. Instead, we relied on setup to do as much as possible for us.</p>
<h2><a id="advanced_setup.hint" name="advanced_setup.hint"><tt>setup.hint (Advanced Options)</tt></a></h2>
<p>The <tt>external-source</tt> line is used when multiple installation packages are generated from a single source package. For example, suppose the <tt>boffo</tt> package contains the executables and documentation for boffo, but there is also a shared library <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> that might be used by other packages; say, the <tt>fobbo</tt> program. It would be nice to separate that <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> shared library into a second installation package, so that users of the <tt>fobbo</tt> program can install <em>just</em> the library, and not the entire <tt>boffo</tt> package. However, all of the <tt>boffo</tt> executables and the DLL are generated from the same source. To support this usage, the <tt>boffo</tt> maintainer would create three package files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains all of the normal contents of <tt>boffo</tt> -- except for the shared library.</li>
  <li><tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains only the shared library from <tt>boffo</tt></li>
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>: the source package for boffo.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>, <tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>, and the boffo <tt>setup.hint</tt> would go into the <tt>release/boffo/</tt> subdirectory. <tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt> would go into a separate subdirectory, such as <tt>release/boffo/libboffo7/</tt>, along with a separate libboffo7 <tt>setup.hint</tt>. The two <tt>setup.hint</tt> files would look something like this:</p>
<center>

<p>The setup.ini generated from these setup.hint files will include these lines (only relevant lines shown):</p>
<pre>
@ boffo
requires: libboffo7 libncurses6 cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
@ libboffo7
requires: cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/libboffo7/libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
</pre>

<p>
  Note that both packages point to the same source tar file. Also, it is required
  that the versions match (libboffo7-5.2 can't point to boffo-1.4-src). The same
  logic is used to "match up" prev: and test: versions with their external
  sources.
</p>

<h2><a id="package_contents" name="package_contents">Package contents</a></h2>
<p>The files paths within both the source and the binary package files are quite important. Since setup extracts into a predetermined directory, you must structure your package contents accordingly.</p>
<p>The following requirements avoid problems that have occured in the past with packages. Thus only skip them if you *know* your package will not recreate that prior problem.</p>
<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    Binary packages are extracted in /, include all file paths from the root in your archive, e.g.:
<pre>
usr/bin/boffo.exe
usr/share/boffo/boffo.dat
etc...
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The package is configured using (at a minimum) the following paths:
<pre>
--prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc
--libexecdir=/usr/lib
--localstatedir=/var
--datadir=/usr/share
--mandir=/usr/share/man
--infodir=/usr/share/info
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>All executables in your binary package are stripped.  </li>
  <li>Source packages are extracted in /usr/src (so the paths in your source tar file should not include /usr/src). On extraction, the tar file should put the sources in a directory with the same name as the package tar file minus the -src.tar.xz part:
<pre>
boffo-1.0-1/boffo.cygport
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0-1.src.patch
etc...
</pre>
  <p>Generally, this will contain the original source tar file, exactly as downloaded from the original upstream, any needed patch files, and a
     cygport script that drives the packaging process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package, you may choose to include a file /usr/share/doc/Cygwin/foo-vendor-suffix.README containing (at a minimum) the information needed for an end user to recreate the package. This includes CFLAGS settings, configure parameters, etc.
    (You can adapt <a href="https://sourceware.org/viewvc/cygwin-apps/packaging/templates/generic-readme?view=co">this generic README</a>.)
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package include a directory /usr/share/doc/foo/ that includes any binary-relevant upstream documentation, such as ChangeLogs, copyright licences, READMEs etc. </li>
  <li>If you are not creating your package from an installed virtual root, be sure to check that the file permissions are appropriate. </li>
  <li>If the package has any global settings (i.e. in files in /etc) that are not overrideable on a per user basis (sshd, as a daemon, is an example of this) do not include the relevant config files in your package. Instead install the files into /etc/defaults and include in your post-install script to install the settings files. Be sure that if you would overwrite an already present file that the user is offered the choice of keeping their own or overwriting with your defaults. </li>
  <li>Ensure that your package handles being installed on binary and text mounts correctly. </li>
</ul>

<p>While older packages exist which satisfy these requirements by hand, the
only accepted way to make a new Cygwin package is using the cygport tool, which
automatically handles most of the above issues for you.  It is also
strongly recommended to convert existing packages to cygport when
updating them; ask on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> list if you need help
converting an existing package to use cygport.</p>

<h2><a id="making_srcpackage" name="making_srcpackage">Making a package with cygport</a></h2>

<p>The <tt>cygport</tt> framework improves
on <a href="setup-packaging-historical.html">previous Cygwin build scripts</a>, and
borrows concepts from the Gentoo portage system.</p>

<p>Suppose that the upstream's <tt>boffo-1.0.tar.xz</tt> source tar file, that you
downloaded from the boffo homepage, unpacks into <tt>boffo-1.0/</tt>.</p>

<p>Further, suppose you've got "boffo" ported to Cygwin. It took some work, but
you've got a patch file, which we will name <tt>boffo-1.0-1.src.patch</tt>, and
with that applied '<tt>boffo</tt>' builds and runs.</p>

<p>All that remains is to write a '<tt>boffo.cygport</tt>' file which
will describe how to unpack, configure, build and package:</p>

<pre>
# package name
NAME="boffo"
VERSION=1.0
RELEASE=1

# setup.hint generation
CATEGORY="Games"
SUMMARY="A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
DESCRIPTION="A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."

# source and patch files
SRC_URI="http://boffo.org/downloads/boffo-${VERSION}.tar.xz"
PATCH_URI="boffo-1.0-fix-whatever.patch"

# use the standard src_compile, src_install and src_test

<p>The source and binary packages can then be built and setup.hint generated by running '<tt>cygport boffo.cygport all</tt>'.</p>

<p>For more information on using <tt>cygport</tt> consult the
<a href="https://cygwinports.github.io/cygport/cygport.1.html">man page</a>,

and sample .cygport files.</p>

<h2><a id="postinstall" name="postinstall">Creating a package postinstall script</a></h2>
<p>If your package requires certain commands to be executed after the files in the package are installed, include them in a file in the package called /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.sh or /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.bat.</p>
<p>If the file's name ends in ".sh", it is executed with the Cygwin shell; if it ends in ".bat", it is executed with the DOS command interpreter. If it doesn't end with either of these suffixes, it is ignored.</p>
<p>After the script has been successfully run it is renamed by appending the suffix ".done" to its previous name, to prevent it from being run again the next time the user runs the setup program.</p>
<p>Note that the setup program runs all the postinstall scripts after all desired packages have been installed, that is, it does not run each package's postinstall script immediately after installing that package. Note, furthermore, that the order in which the scripts are run is not guaranteed. Therefore, if your package depends on others which have their own postinstall scripts, you cannot assume in your script that the other packages' scripts have already been run.</p>
<h2><a id="submitting" name="submitting">Submitting a new package</a></h2>
<p>So you've got a package you want to submit. Follow the following checklist before emailing the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list and you'll almost certainly save time.</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Do you have the time to maintain the package?</i><br />
   Packages without active maintainers are pulled from the distribution. Generally speaking the time commitment is relatively low, simply subscribe to the <tt>cygwin</tt> mailing list. We'd prefer if you read the non-digest mode since prompt response to packaging issues is a plus. When a <i>bug</i> in your package is reported in the cygwin mailing list, address the bug (if it's a Cygwin-only bug) or pass back to the upstream. When a solution exists, create and upload an updated package with the fix in it. Note that you are not expected to be a helpdesk for the package - the users should be pointed to the upstream's lists if you've determined that the bug is not a Cygwin-related bug.</li>
  <li>
    Propose on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list that you are interested in becoming a package maintainer for package "foo" using a subject like "[<a href="acronyms/#ITP">ITP</a>] foo 0.10". Some packages cannot be distributed via Cygwin's setup due to upstream licence limitations. Other packages may not be appropriate for Cygwin. This step will save time if, for some reason, we cannot accept the package.<br />
    Submission rules:<br />
    <ul>
      <li><b>Include a complete <tt>setup.hint</tt> file as part of your proposal</b>. Include this file in the text of your message so that it can be commented on. Do not submit it as an attachment.</li>
      <li>If the new package is a well-known program already included in a major Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Fedora, SuSE) please <b>include the URL</b> of the package page.  Note that "development", "test", and "unstable" packages are <b>not eligible</b> for this rule.</li>
      <li>If the package is not included in any major Linux distro it must receive <b>five positive votes</b> from other package maintainers in order to be accepted.</li>
      <li>It's helpful to mention which <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">open source license</a> applies to the source.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to create a good <tt>setup.hint</tt> file do read and follow the documentation in the <a href="#setup.hint">specific section</a> of this very web page.<br />
    A few things to take extra care to:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>In order to select an appropriate a correct <tt>Category</tt> you can look in the Debian package list and identify the section that your package is present in there - if it's available via Debian. If it's not, have a look and take a sensible guess. Use <a href="#categories">existing categories</a> if at all possible.</li>
      <li>Do not use the package name in <tt>sdesc</tt>, as it is added automatically by the setup program.</li>
      <li>Opinion on whether to mark your initial version as a <tt>Test</tt> version is currently mixed. If you have doubts about the stability of your initial offering you may decide to mark it as <tt>Test</tt>. Then, once the package has no major bug reports from users, a current package may be introduced. Otherwise, it is perfectly acceptable to forgo the <tt>Test</tt> designation in your first release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the package files in a web accessible http/ftp site somewhere. If at all possible the files should have a directory structure in order to get them all with a single command. For example, if I am proposing "foo" and "libfoo", an upload site should look like:<br />
    <ul>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/x86/foo/foo-0.20.3-1.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/x86/foo/foo-0.20.3-1-src.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/x86/foo/setup.hint</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/x86/foo/libfoo/libfoo-0.20.3-1.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/x86/foo/libfoo/setup.hint</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Announce on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list that you have the package ready for uploading. Provide the URLs of all package files to your mail.</li>
  <li>Each new package must in any case receive one <a href="acronyms/#GTG">GTG</a> vote from a package maintainer, meaning that an existing maintainer has downloaded the package, inspected the tar file contents, tested the applications, and rebuilt the package from the source tar file without incident. Once a successful package is produced, you become a maintainer yourself and can provide GTG reviews for others as well.</li>

</ol>
<h2><a id="acceptance" name="acceptance">Uploading an accepted package</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Once you have your GTG,
      follow <a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-upload.html">these
      instructions</a> for submitting a ssh key and uploading your package files.</li>
  <li>Announce via the <tt>cygwin-announce</tt> mailing list that the new package is available. Use the <a href="#announcement">announce message example</a> listed later in this page as a template for your announcement.<br />
    Be sure the unsubscribe instructions are included at the end of the email, since cygwin-announce does not add any.<br />
    Once sent, your message will be reviewed by one of the cygwin-announce moderators and, once approved, will be automatically forwarded to the cygwin mailing list with an [ANNOUNCEMENT] prepended to the subject.</li>
  <li>Feel free to delete your local copy once the files have been uploaded to sourceware.org.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="updating" name="updating">Updating a package</a></h2>
<p>So you've got an updated package you want to submit. You should
  already have upload privileges, and should be able to do the entire
  process yourself, by
  following <a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-upload.html">these
  instructions</a>.  If you encounter any problems, email
  the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list.
<ol>
  <li>There is no need to increase the release number if the package has not been officially released.  So, if you are releasing a -1 release of a package keep using -1 for any refinements <em>until</em> the package has been uploaded.</li>
  <li>Thereafter, you <em>must</em> increase the version or release number when
    uploading an updated version of the package.</li>
  <li>After doing a upload, announce via the <tt>cygwin-announce</tt> mailing list that the new package is available. Use the <a href="#announcement">announce message example</a> listed later in this page as a template for your announcement..<br />
   Once sent, your message will be reviewed by one of the cygwin-announce moderators and, once approved, will be automatically forwarded to the cygwin mailing list with an [ANNOUNCEMENT] prepended to the subject.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: On any major version upgrade, you may want to mark the release as <tt>Test</tt>.</p>
