<h1>Cygwin Package Contributor's Guide</h1>
<p>This document is intended for people who post packages to sourceware.org, and thus need to make them available through the standard Cygwin setup program. This documents the syntax of the setup.hint file, the program that automatically generates it on a regular basis, the layout required for packages, and the related policies to ensure good behaviour from the setup program.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">Setup</a> depends on certain conventions being followed. If they are not followed, bad things may happen to the users of the setup program. Where a convention can be ignored, should circumstances warrant, this document will specify that. Setup has it's own homepage <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html</a>. If you are interested in adding features to setup, or in manually creating a setup.ini file, you should consult the setup homepage.</p>
<p>The <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list is the correct place to discuss any package creation or maintenance issues. It is not a place for end user bug reports - direct those to the <tt>cygwin</tt> mailing list instead.</p>

<h2><a id="naming" name="naming">Package file naming</a></h2>
<p>Package naming scheme: use the vendor's version plus a release
  suffix for ports of existing packages (i.e. findutils 4.5.12 becomes
  4.5.12-1, 4.5.12-2, etc., until findutils 4.5.13 is ported, which
  would be 4.5.13-1, etc). Some packages also use a YYYYMMDD format for
  their versions, e.g. terminfo-5.9-20140524-1.tar.xz. The first release
  of a package should have a -1 release suffix.</p>
<p>A complete package currently consists of three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a binary tar file</li>
  <li>a source tar file</li>
  <li>a setup.hint file</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary tar files are named "package-version-release.tar.xz". They generally contain the executable files that will be installed on a user's system plus any auxiliary files needed by the package. See the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section below for more details on the contents of a binary tar file.</p>
<p>Source tar files are named "package-version-release-src.tar.xz". Source tar files should contain the source files, patches and scripts needed to rebuild the package. While installing these files is optional, the inclusion of a source tar file is part of the totality that makes up a Cygwin package and so, these files are <em>not</em> optional. In some cases, there may be multiple packages generated from the same source; for instance, one might have a "boffo" package and its associated shared library in "libboffo7", where both are generated from the same -src tarball. See the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section below for more details on the contents of a -src tar file, and the <a href="#setup.hint">setup.hint</a> section for information on the "external-source:" option.</p>
<p>Note that package files may be .bz2, .gzip or .xz compressed.  .gzip is deprecated and .xz is preferred for new package submissions.</p>
<p>The setup.hint file is discussed <a href="#setup.hint">below</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="sourceware.org" name="sourceware.org">Automatic setup.ini generation on sourceware.org</a></h2>
<p>A script runs on sourceware.org which collects information from (currently) the <tt>release</tt> directory in the ftp download area. Information from subdirectories of these directories is parsed to automatically generate the default <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html#setup.ini">setup.ini</a> file which is used by the Cygwin setup program for installation control. If you are responsible for maintaining a Cygwin package, it is important that you understand how this process works.</p>
<p>Packages are grouped by directory under <tt>release</tt>. The directory name is the same as the package name. For example, the <tt>boffo</tt> package will live in the <tt>boffo</tt> subdirectory. Exceptions to this rule are historical. All new packages will follow the rule of package name == directory name. However, for closely related groups of packages, it is acceptable to use a hierarchical tree under <tt>release/</tt>:</p>
<pre>
release/
release/boffo/
release/boffo/&lt;boffo files&gt;
release/boffo/boffo-devel/
release/boffo/boffo-devel/&lt;boffo-devel file&gt;
</pre>
<p>Each directory contains <a href="#naming">source and binary tar files</a> which have been been compressed. The required <a href="#naming">format of these filenames</a> is: <tt>package-version-release[<i>-src</i>].tar.xz</tt> . The contents of these files is discussed <a href="#package_contents">below</a>.</p>
<p>The "package" part of the filename is the name mentioned above.</p>
<p>The version number <b>must</b> start with a digit and must adhere to the rules in <a href="#naming">package file naming</a> above. Higher version (and release) numbers are used for the current version of a package; the previous stable version (if any) is used for the previous version (however see <a href="#setup.hint">setup.hint</a> for exceptions to this rule). Lexically, when two packages have identical vendor version numbers, the one with the higher release number is considered newer. Also, given two packages, the one with the higher vendor version number is always considered newer, regardless of the release number.</p>
<p>The <i>-src</i> component of the filename is added to files which contain source code.</p>
<p>A complete "package" is made up of three files: the "binary" package tar file, the "source" tar file, and the "setup.hint" file, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
bash$ ls release/boffo
boffo-1.0-1.tar.xz  boffo-1.0-1-src.tar.xz  setup.hint
</pre>
<p>Setup is currently unable to list more than three versions of each package. Therefore you should not keep more than three versions of each package around: The current version, the previous stable version, and, optionally, one test version. By keeping a previous stable version around, you isolate yourself (somewhat) from problems with partial mirrors. When you add a new "current" version, you can either keep the old "previous" version, or make the old current version the new previous version, depending on how stable they each were.</p>
<p>Test versions are specified via the setup.hint file as described <a href="#setup.hint">below</a>. It is not required that your package have a <tt>test</tt> version. Use of a <tt>test</tt> version of a package is at the discretion of the package maintainer.</p>
<h2><a id="setup.hint" name="setup.hint"><tt>setup.hint</tt></a></h2>
<p>Each package must be submitted with a file called <tt>setup.hint</tt>. This file is used for information that cannot be inferred just from the context of the file name or package name. Lines in <tt>setup.hint</tt> will consist of one of the following:</p>
<pre>
# <i>comment</i>
@ <i>package</i>
sdesc: <i>"some text"</i>
ldesc: <i>"some text"</i>
skip:
curr: <i>version</i>
prev: <i>version</i>
test: <i>version</i>
category: <i>name1[ name2...]</i>
requires: <i>package[ package...]</i>
external-source: <i>package</i>
</pre>
<h4 align="center">Note: Not all of the above setup.hint lines are required. Please read the description below for further details on how to construct a setup.hint file.</h4>
<p>(You may see some older setup.hint files which lack the colons after the introducing field. This usage is allowed but deprecated. Please use colons in your setup.hint for everything but '#' and '@'.)</p>
<p>Lines that begin with '#' are considered to be comments and are ignored by the setup.ini generator.</p>
<p>A line that begins with a "<tt>@</tt>" behaves similarly to the setup.ini field (<a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html#setup.ini">see below</a>). It overrides the package name for the enclosing directory. This is an optional entry. It is intended only for historical packages where the package name is different from the name of the directory in which the package resides. This should not be necessary for "modern" setup.hint files. <em>Do not use this unless you've been instructed to do so.</em></p>
<p>The <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, and <tt>test</tt> lines indicate which versions should be used for which sections of that package. Use these settings <em>only</em> if you need to circumvent the normal intuitive version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Use of <tt>curr</tt> and <tt>prev</tt> is usually not required since the setup.ini generator does a good job of figuring out version number ordering. So, e.g. if you had previously released <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt> and now have a new <tt>boffo-1.0-1</tt>, the version numbering is obvious and there is no need to use <tt>curr</tt> or <tt>prev</tt>. It is obvious that <tt>boffo-1.0-1</tt> is newer than <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt> and the setup.ini generator will do the right thing in this case.</p>
<p>However, if you had discovered a serious error in the <tt>boffo-1.0</tt> release, and then decided that you want to drop back to <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt>, you could include entries like this:</p>
<pre>
prev: 1.0-1
curr: 0.9-1
</pre>
This usage should be rare, however.
<p>In general, you should trust the automatic setup.ini generator to "do the right thing" -- with one exception. If you decide that you need to release a <i>test</i> version of your package, there is no way for the setup.ini generator to know that.</p>
<p>So, you will have to put something like "<tt>test: 1.9-1</tt>" in your setup.hint file. This will cause setup to characterize the 1.9-1 version as a "test" package. With the current setup implementation, it will also mean that it will be overlooked by most people during installation. So, unless you have made arrangements to advertise your test release, this option should be used sparingly.</p>
<p>Note that if any of the <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, or <tt>test</tt> options are used, they will short circuit <em>all</em> of the automatic version detection used for generating setup.ini. So, if you include a <tt>test</tt> option, and you have valid current and/or previous tar files, you <em>must</em> specify <tt>curr</tt> and/or <tt>prev</tt>. Otherwise, the <b>only</b> version that setup will display will be the <tt>test</tt> version.</p>
<p>For example, if your setup.hint looks like this:</p>
<pre>
test: 1.9-1
</pre>
<p>then setup.ini will not contain the 0.9-1 or 1.0-1 versions.
<p>If you want all of the versions included, you must do this:</p>
<pre>
prev: 0.9-1
curr: 1.0-1
test: 1.9-1
</pre>
<p>The <tt>skip</tt> line indicates that that package should not appear in setup.ini. It is intended for directories that exist in the hierarchy that should not be considered for inclusion in setup.ini.</p>
<p><tt>sdesc</tt> is a mandatory field for setup.hint. Your package <em>must</em> contain this field. The <tt>sdesc</tt> field is required for correct operation of the setup program.</p>
<p><tt>sdesc</tt> is a one line description of the package. This is the information that will be displayed when installing packages via setup.</p>
<p><tt>ldesc</tt> is a more descriptive, multi-line description of the package, intended for future use.</p>
<p>Please note that the package name should <em>not</em> be part of the description, e.g. this is incorrect:
<pre>
sdesc:      "boffo: A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>
<p>This is correct:
<pre>
sdesc:      "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>
<p>Quote text that takes up several lines e.g.:</p>
<pre>
ldesc: "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>
<p>The <tt>category</tt> line indicates the categories that this package belongs to. One package can belong to multiple categories. Multiple categories are separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Do not enclose multiple category names within quotation marks.</p>
<a name="categories" />
<p>Please do not invent a new category without checking with the cygwin-apps mailing list first. As of this writing, the current categories are:</p>
<table width="50%" align="center">

<p>As you can see, currently, all categories consist of only a single word. We don't anticipate that this will change anytime soon. However, with the use of quotes, setup will understand category names which contain spaces, for example:</p>
<pre>
category: "ASCII Games"
</pre>
<p>The above would place a package in a single category called "ASCII Games" rather than two categories "ASCII" and "Games".</p>
<p>The <tt>requires</tt> line indicates the packages that this package relies on. If your package is dependent on a file provided by another package that other package should be included here. The requires field may be missing or empty if your package truly does not require any other package.</p>
<p>A package can rely on multiple other packages. Hierarchical dependencies should work correctly, however, it is best to always include specific dependencies, i.e. don't drop '<tt>bar</tt>' from your dependency list if your package requires it, even if you are including '<tt>foo</tt>' which relies on '<tt>bar</tt>'.</p>
<p>Conversely, do not include package dependencies of <em>dependent</em> packages in your dependency list. If you think that another package has an incorrect dependency list, send email to cygwin-apps noting that fact.</p>
<p>Multiple packages are separated by spaces. Do not enclose multiple package names within quotation marks.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a complete <i>release/boffo/setup.hint</i>:</p>
<pre>
category: Games Text
requires: libncurses6 cygwin
sdesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
ldesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>
<p>Notice that we didn't use the <tt>prev</tt>, <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>test</tt>, or <tt>@</tt> options. Instead, we relied on the automatic setup.ini generator to do as much as possible for us.</p>
<h3><a id="advanced_setup.hint" name="advanced_setup.hint"><tt>setup.hint (Advanced Options)</tt></a></h3>
<p>The <tt>external-source</tt> line is used when multiple installation packages are generated from a single -src package. For example, suppose the <tt>boffo</tt> package contains the executables and documentation for boffo, but there is also a shared library <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> that might be used by other packages; say, the <tt>fobbo</tt> program. It would be nice to separate that <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> shared library into a second installation package, so that users of the <tt>fobbo</tt> program can install <em>just</em> the library, and not the entire <tt>boffo</tt> package. However, all of the <tt>boffo</tt> executables and the DLL are generated from the same source. To support this usage, the <tt>boffo</tt> maintainer would create three packages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains all of the normal contents of <tt>boffo</tt> -- except for the shared library.</li>
  <li><tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains only the shared library from <tt>boffo</tt></li>
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>: the -src tarball for boffo.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>, <tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>, and the boffo <tt>setup.hint</tt> would go into the <tt>release/boffo/</tt> subdirectory on the Cygwin server. <tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt> would go into a separate subdirectory, such as <tt>release/boffo/libboffo7/</tt>, along with a separate libboffo7 <tt>setup.hint</tt>. The two <tt>setup.hint</tt> files would look something like this:</p>
<center>
  <table border="2">

<p>The setup.ini generated from these setup.hint files will include these lines (only relevant lines shown):</p>
<pre>
@ boffo
requires: libboffo7 libncurses6 cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
@ libboffo7
requires: cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/libboffo7/libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
</pre>
<p>Note that both packages point to the same -src tarball. Also, it is required that the version strings match (libboffo7-5.2 won't point to boffo-1.4-src). The same logic is used to "match up" prev: and test: versions.</p>
<h2><a id="package_contents" name="package_contents">Package contents</a></h2>
<p>The files paths within both the -src and the binary package files are quite important. Since setup extracts into a predetermined directory, you must structure your package contents accordingly.</p>
<p>The following requirements avoid problems that have occured in the past with packages. Thus only skip them if you *know* your package will not recreate that prior problem.</p>
<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    Binary packages are extracted in /, include all file paths from the root in your archive, e.g.:
<pre>
usr/bin/boffo.exe
usr/share/boffo/boffo.dat
etc...
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The package is configured using (at a minimum) the following paths:
<pre>
--prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc
--libexecdir=/usr/lib
--localstatedir=/var
--datadir=/usr/share
--mandir=/usr/share/man
--infodir=/usr/share/info
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>All executables in your binary package are stripped.  </li>
  <li>Source packages are extracted in /usr/src (so the paths in your -src tarball should not include /usr/src). On extraction, the tar file should put the sources in a directory with the same name as the package tarball minus the -src.tar.xz part:
<pre>
boffo-1.0-1/boffo.cygport
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0-1.src.patch
etc...
</pre>
  <p>Generally, this will contain the original source tarball, exactly as downloaded from the original vendor, any needed patch files, and a
     cygport script that drives the packaging process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package, you may choose to include a file /usr/share/doc/Cygwin/foo-vendor-suffix.README containing (at a minimum) the information needed for an end user to recreate the package. This includes CFLAGS settings, configure parameters, etc.
    (You can adapt <a href="http://sourceware.org/viewvc/cygwin-apps/packaging/templates/generic-readme?view=co">this generic README</a>.)
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package include a directory /usr/share/doc/foo/ that includes any binary-relevant vendor documentation, such as ChangeLogs, copyright licences, READMEs etc. </li>
  <li>If you are not creating your package from an installed virtual root, be sure to check that the file permissions are appropriate. </li>
  <li>If the package has any global settings (i.e. in files in /etc) that are not overrideable on a per user basis (sshd, as a daemon, is an example of this) do not include the relevant config files in your package. Instead install the files into /etc/defaults and include in your post-install script to install the settings files. Be sure that if you would overwrite an already present file that the user is offered the choice of keeping their own or overwriting with your defaults. </li>
  <li>Ensure that your package handles being installed on binary and text mounts correctly. </li>
</ul>

<p>While older packages exist which satisfy these requirements by hand, the
only accepted way to make a new Cygwin package is using the cygport tool, which
automatically handles most of the above issues for you.  It is also
strongly recommended to convert existing packages to cygport when
updating them; ask on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> list if you need help
converting an existing package to use cygport.</p>

<h2><a id="making_srcpackage" name="making_srcpackage">Making a package with cygport</a></h2>

<p>The <tt>cygport</tt> framework improves
on <a href="setup-packaging-historical.html">previous Cygwin build scripts</a>, and
borrows concepts from the Gentoo portage system.</p>

<p>Suppose that the vendor's <tt>boffo-1.0.tar.xz</tt> source tarball, that you
downloaded from the boffo homepage, unpacks into <tt>boffo-1.0/</tt>.</p>

<p>Further, suppose you've got "boffo" ported to Cygwin. It took some work, but
you've got a patch file, which we will name <tt>boffo-1.0-1.src.patch</tt>, and
with that applied '<tt>boffo</tt>' builds and runs.</p>

<p>All that remains is to write a '<tt>boffo.cygport</tt>' file which
will describe how to unpack, configure, build and package:</p>

<pre>
# package name
NAME="boffo"
VERSION=1.0
RELEASE=1

# setup.hint generation
CATEGORY="Games"
SUMMARY="A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
DESCRIPTION="A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."

# source and patch files
SRC_URI="http://boffo.org/downloads/boffo-${VERSION}.tar.xz"
PATCH_URI="boffo-1.0-fix-whatever.patch"

# use the standard src_compile, src_install and src_test
</pre>

<p>The source and binary packages can then be built and setup.hint generated by running '<tt>cygport boffo.cygport all</tt>'.</p>

<p>For more information on using <tt>cygport</tt> consult the
<a href="https://cygwinports.github.io/cygport/cygport.1.html">man page</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cygwinports/cygport/blob/master/README">README</a>,
<a href="https://cygwinports.github.io/cygport/toc_index.html">reference manual</a>
and sample .cygport files.</p>

<h2><a id="postinstall" name="postinstall">Creating a package postinstall script</a></h2>
<p>If your package requires certain commands to be executed after the files in the package are installed, include them in a file in the package called /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.sh or /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.bat.</p>
<p>If the file's name ends in ".sh", it is executed with the Cygwin shell; if it ends in ".bat", it is executed with the DOS command interpreter. If it doesn't end with either of these suffixes, it is ignored.</p>
<p>After the script has been successfully run it is renamed by appending the suffix ".done" to its previous name, to prevent it from being run again the next time the user runs the setup program.</p>
<p>Note that the setup program runs all the postinstall scripts after all desired packages have been installed, that is, it does not run each package's postinstall script immediately after installing that package. Note, furthermore, that the order in which the scripts are run is not guaranteed. Therefore, if your package depends on others which have their own postinstall scripts, you cannot assume in your script that the other packages' scripts have already been run.</p>
<h2><a id="submitting" name="submitting">Submitting a new package</a></h2>
<p>So you've got a package you want to submit. Follow the following checklist before emailing the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list and you'll almost certainly save time.</p>

  <li><i>Do you have the time to maintain the package?</i><br />
   Packages without active maintainers are pulled from the distribution. Generally speaking the time commitment is relatively low, simply subscribe to the <tt>cygwin</tt> mailing list. We'd prefer if you read the non-digest mode since prompt response to packaging issues is a plus. When a <i>bug</i> in your package is reported in the cygwin mailing list, address the bug (if it's a Cygwin-only bug) or pass back to the vendor. When a solution exists, create an updated package with the fix in it, and send a notification that you need the package uploaded to cygwin-apps. Note that you are not expected to be a helpdesk for the package - the users should be pointed to the vendor's lists if you've determined that the bug is not a Cygwin-related bug.</li>
  <li>
    Propose on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list that you are interested in becoming a package maintainer for package "foo" using a subject like "[<a href="acronyms/#ITP">ITP</a>] foo 0.10". Some packages cannot be distributed via Cygwin's setup due to vendor licence limitations. Other packages may not be appropriate for Cygwin. This step will save time if, for some reason, we cannot accept the package.<br />
     Submission rules:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Include a complete <tt>setup.hint</tt> file as part of your proposal</b>. Include this file in the text of your message so that it can be commented on. Do not submit it as an attachment.</li>
      <li>If the new package is a well-known program already included in a major Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Fedora, SuSE) please <b>include the URL</b> of the package page.  Note that "development", "test", and "unstable" packages are <b>not eligible</b> for this rule.</li>
      <li>If the package is not included in any major Linux distro it must receive <b>five positive votes</b> from other package maintainers in order to be accepted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to create a good <tt>setup.hint</tt> file do read and follow the documentation in the <a href="#setup.hint">specific section</a> of this very web page.<br />
     A few things to take extra care to:
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid the "@ foo" line at the beginning of the file: it is added automatically.</li>
      <li>In order to select an appropriate a correct <tt>Category</tt> you can look in the Debian package list and identify the section that your package is present in there - if it's available via Debian. If it's not, have a look and take a sensible guess. Use <a href="#categories">existing categories</a> if at all possible.</li>
      <li>Do not use the package name in <tt>sdesc</tt>, as it is added automatically by the setup program.</li>
      <li>Opinion on whether to mark your initial version as a <tt>Test</tt> version is currently mixed. If you have doubts about the stability of your initial offering you may decide to mark it as <tt>Test</tt>. Then, once the package has no major bug reports from users, a current package may be introduced. Otherwise, it is perfectly acceptable to forgo the <tt>Test</tt> designation in your first release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Place the package files in a web accessible http/ftp site somewhere. If at all possible the files should have a directory structure in order to get them all with a single command. For example, if I am proposing "foo" and "libfoo", an upload site should look like:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/foo/foo-0.20.3-1.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/foo/foo-0.20.3-1-src.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/foo/setup.hint</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/foo/libfoo/libfoo-0.20.3-1.tar.xz</tt></li>
      <li><tt>myserver.com/whatever/foo/libfoo/setup.hint</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Announce on the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list that you have the package ready for uploading. Provide the URLs of all package files to your mail.</li>
  <li>Each new package must in any case receive one <a href="acronyms/#GTG">GTG</a> vote from a package maintainer, meaning that an existing maintainer has downloaded the package, inspected the tarball contents, tested the applications, and rebuilt the package from the source tarball without incident. Once a successful package is produced, you become a maintainer yourself and can provide GTG reviews for others as well.</li>
  <li>Once you have your first GTG,
  follow <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-upload.html">these
  instructions</a> for setting up your upload ssh key, and uploading
  your files.</li>
  <li>Feel free to delete your temporary copy once the files have been uploaded to sourceware.org.</li>
  <li>Announce via the <tt>cygwin-announce</tt> mailing list that the new package is available. Use the <a href="#announcement">announce message example</a> listed later in this page as a template for your announcement.<br />
   Be sure the unsubscribe instructions are included at the end of the email, since cygwin-announce does not add any.<br />
   Once sent, your message will be reviewed by one of the cygwin-announce moderators and, once approved, will be automatically forwarded to the cygwin mailing list with an [ANNOUNCEMENT] prepended to the subject.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="acceptance" name="acceptance">Package acceptance</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Build the package and make sure that you have time to maintain it.</li>
  <li>Send an ITP to the cygwin mailing list.  If the package is part of a distribution, include the URL which demonstrates this.  Include a <tt>setup.hint</tt>.</li>
  <li>If you have received the correct number of votes or if the package is part of a distribution, include URL(s) for the package binary and source so that someone can download them to check the package for any obvious problems.</li>
  <li>Once you get a GTG from a package maintainer,
  follow <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-upload.html">these
  instructions</a> for uploading your package.</li>
  <li>When you get the "uploaded" confirmation, send an immediate note to the <tt>cygwin-announce</tt> mailing list.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="updating" name="updating">Updating a package</a></h2>
<p>So you've got an updated package you want to submit. You should
  already have upload privileges, and should be able to do the entire
  process yourself, by
  following <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/package-upload.html">these
  instructions</a>.  If you encounter any problems, email
  the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list.
<ol>
  <li>There is no need to increase the version number if the package has not been officially released.  So, if you are releasing a -1 version of a package keep using -1 for any refinements <em>until</em> the package has been uploaded.</li>
  <li>After doing a self-upload, announce via the <tt>cygwin-announce</tt> mailing list that the new package is available. Use the <a href="#announcement">announce message example</a> listed later in this page as a template for your announcement..<br />
   Once sent, your message will be reviewed by one of the cygwin-announce moderators and, once approved, will be automatically forwarded to the cygwin mailing list with an [ANNOUNCEMENT] prepended to the subject.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: On any major version upgrade, you may want to mark the release as <tt>Test</tt>.</p>
