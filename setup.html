<h1 align=center>Setup.INI Developer's Guide</h1>

<p>This document is intended for people who post packages to
sources.redhat.com, and thus need to make them available through the
standard Cygwin setup program.  This documents the syntax of the
setup.ini file, and the program that automatically generates it on a
regular basis.

<p> Recommended package versioning scheme: use the vendor's version
plus a suffix for ports of existing packages (i.e. bash 2.04 becomes
2.04-1, 2.04-2, etc, until bash 2.05 is ported, which would be 2.05-1,
etc).  Some packages also use a YYMMDD format for their versions, e.g.
binutils-20010901.tar.bz2.  Binary tarballs are "package-version.tar.bz2"
while source tarballs are "package-version-src.tar.bz2".</p>

<h2>Automatic setup.ini generation on sources.redhat.com</h2>

A script runs on sources.redhat.com which collects information from
the<tt> latest </tt>and<tt> contrib </tt> directories (possibly more in
the future) and automatically generates the default setup.ini.  If you
are putting packages in these directories, it is important that you
understand how this program works.

<p>Files that end in ".tar.bz2" or ".tar.gz" automatically qualify as
packages.  It is assumed that the file name is package-version[-src].tar.bz2,
and that the version number starts with a digit.  Higher version numbers
are used for the current version of a package; the next stable version
(if any) is used for the previous version.</p>

<p>We recommend you keep no more than three versions of each package around:
The current version, the previous stable version, and one test
version.  By keeping a previous stable version around, you isolate
yourself (somewhat) from problems with partial mirrors.  When you add
a new "current" version, you can either keep the old "previous"
version, or make the old current version the new previous version,
depending on how stable they each were.

<p>Test versions are specified via the setup.hint file as described
below.</p>

<h2><tt>setup.hint</tt></h2>

<p>If the above rules don't work for your package, for some reason, you
can amend them with a file called<tt> setup.hint </tt> which provides
additional information for<tt> setup.ini </tt> to use.  Note that
these files must be in subdirectories named after the package
(i.e. <tt>latest/cygwin/setup.hint</tt> is for the cygwin package).
Each line in<tt> setup.hint </tt> is one of the following:

<pre>
@ <i>package</i>
sdesc <i>some text</i>
ldesc <i>some text</i>
skip
curr <i>version</i>
prev <i>version</i>
test <i>version</i>
category <i>name1[ name2...]</i>
requires <i>package[ package...]</i>
</pre>

<p>A line that begins with a "<tt>@</tt>" behaves similarly to the setup.ini
field (see below).  It overrides the package name for the enclosing
directory.</p>

The <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, and <tt>test</tt> lines indicate which versions should be used
for which sections of that package.  If any of them are valid, they
replace <em>all</em> versions in setup.ini.</p>

<p>The <tt>skip</tt> line indicates that that package should not appear in
setup.ini.</p>

<p>The <tt>sdesc</tt> and <tt>ldesc</tt> texts are simply copied to setup.ini in the
appropriate place.  Quote the text if you want the text to continue
over multiple lines, e.g.:

<pre>
ldesc "this is
a multi-line
ldesc"
</pre>

<p>The <tt>category</tt> line indicates the categories that this package belongs
to.  One package can belong to multiple categories.  Multiple categories
are separated by spaces.</p>

<p>Please do not invent a new category without checking with the cygwin-apps
mailing list first.  As of this writing, the current categories are:<br>
<table width=50% align=center>
<tr>
<td>Admin</td>
<td>Archive</td>
<td>Base</td>
<td>Database</td>
<td>Devel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Doc</td>
<td>Editors</td>
<td>Graphics</td>
<td>Interpreters</td>
<td>Libs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mail</td>
<td>Net</td>
<td>Shells</td>
<td>System</td>
<td>Text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Utils</td>
<td>Web</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The <tt>requires</tt> line indicates the packages that this package belongs to.
A package can rely on multiple packages.  Multiple packages are
separated by spaces.</p>

<p>Note colons following keywords are optional in setup.hint file while they
are mandatory in setup.ini.</p>

<h2><tt>setup.ini</tt></h2>

<p>Note that <tt>setup.ini</tt> is automatically generated.  This
section is for completeness, not instruction.

<p>Setup reads a file called<tt> setup.ini </tt> that resides on all
cygwin FTP mirrors.  There are a two global parameters in this file,
followed by a list of packages.  Any line beginning with<tt> # </tt> is
ignored by setup and can be used to add commentary to the file at any
point.

<p><tt>setup-timestamp: <i>number</i></tt></p>

This line is at the beginning of all setup.ini files.  It indicates
the time that the setup.ini file was created.  Its only purpose is to
warn the user when the timestamp is <em>less</em> than the last
setup.ini used; i.e. it prevents accidental regression.  Use "perl -e
'print time'" to get a timestamp.

<p><tt>setup-version: <i>number</i></tt></p>

This line follows the setup-timestamp in all setupl.ini files.  It
indicates the version number of the setup.exe for which this setup.ini
was generated.

<p><tt>@ <i>package</i></tt></p>

Lines beginning with the "at" symbol indicate the start of a package
section.  Each package consists of a name, one or more descriptive
texts, package categories, package requirements, and up to three version
definitions.

<p><tt>sdesc: <i>"some text"</i></tt></p>

This is the "short description" of the package.  This text, if
available, accompanies the package name in package listings.

<p><tt>ldesc: <i>"some text"</i></tt></p>

This is the "long description" of the package.  This text, if
available, is used as a supplimental description of the package.

<p><tt>category: <i>name1[ name2...]</i></tt></p>

The category line indicates the categories that this package belongs to.
One package can belong to multiple categories.  Multiple categories are
separated by spaces.  See the description of categories in setup.hint
above for more information on categories.

<p><tt>requires: <i>package[ package...]</i></tt></p>

The requires line indicates the packages that this package belongs to.  A
package can rely on multiple packages.  Multiple packages are separated
by spaces.

<p><tt>[curr]<br>[prev]<br>[test]</tt></p>

These indicate the start of a version description within a package.
Note that<tt> [curr] </tt> is the default and may be omitted if that
version happens to be specified before the others.  "Curr" indicates
the current stable (preferred) version, "prev" is the previous stable
version, and "test" indicates a test or experimental version.

<p><tt>version: <i>version</i></tt></p>

Indicates the version of the package.  While this can be derived from
the file names, it currently is not, and in some cases cannot reliably
be.

<p><tt>install: <i>filename</i> <i>size-in-bytes</i></tt></p>

Indicates the file to install for that version, and its size in bytes.
The file name must include the full path (relative to setup.ini's
directory), and the file size must match the actual file size (setup
uses this to verify it got the whole file).

<p><tt>source: <i>filename</i> <i>size-in-bytes</i></tt></p>

Like the file to install, this is the corresponding sources.
