<h1>Uploading Packages to cygwin.com</h1>

<p>
<font size="+1">If you are a package maintainer you will need to request sftp upload privileges to the
Cygwin distro.  This page documents how to request the privileges and
upload packages to cygwin.com.</font>
</p>

<h2>Requesting upload privileges</h2>

<p>Send your public ssh key to the <a href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html#cygwin-apps">cygwin-apps</a> using this format:</p>

<pre><tt>    Subject: SSH key for upload access

    Name: Your Name
    Package: The name of <b>one</b> (and only one) of the packages that you are responsible for
    ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>encoded public ssh key here</em>
    ---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
</tt></pre>

<p>When specifying your name, use your exact name as shown at <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint</a>.<br/>
Specifying <b>one</b> package provides you with the ability to upload
any of your packages from <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint</a>.</p>

<p>The SSH key above should be generated from one of your public keys, e.g.:<pre><tt>    ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre></tt></p>

<p>The format of this email is not optional.  It is read by a program so please
do not deviate from the above.  In particular, don't indent, don't add multiple
packages, and <b>do</b> use <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">your name</a> as
recorded in  <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note: Send email in this format if you need to update your ssh key.</b></p>

<p>Requests are handled manually and are acknowledged publicly in
response to email to the <tt>cygwin-apps</tt> mailing list.</p>

<h2>Connecting to cygwin.com</h2>

<p>Once the ssh key has been installed you'll have limited
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol#SFTP_client">sftp</a>
access to cygwin.com, where you will be able to upload packages.  You may connect for example by
<tt>sftp cygwin@cygwin.com</tt>, or using lftp as in the example below.  When connecting,
make sure that you use the user <tt>cygwin</tt> with no password, and that you are using the
same ssh key as the one that you specified previously.</p>

<p>The first time you connect, you should verify that the host key fingerprint matches one of
the following hashes:</p>

<ul>
<li>SHA256 (OpenSSH 6.8 or later): <tt>SHA256:MFNiczzfX8/nvLSRZwR3CxMyycKtMan64Zm4C373FeM</tt>
<li>MD5 (OpenSSH pre-6.8): <tt>1d:1e:46:7f:4d:73:8d:10:20:c3:4c:5a:34:14:44:23</tt>
</ul>

<h2>Uploading Files</h2>

There are two ways to upload finished packages to cygwin.com.

<h3>Using cygport</h3>

<p>If you have a <a href="https://cygwin.com/cygport/README">cygport</a> build script for your
packages, the easiest way to upload your finished packages is just to run:</p>

<pre>    cygport pkg.cygport up</pre>

<p>That will upload your finished packages, taking care of all of the details described in the manual method below.</p>

<h3>Manually</h3>

<p>You may also upload files directly, using an sftp client such as sftp or lftp. An upload
directory on cygwin.com will look like this:</p>

<pre>
       Your Name                          # directory is currently your full name (you won't actually see this)
        !packages                         # read-only file containing package names you are permitted to upload
        x86        x86_64    noarch       # arch directory
         release    release   release     # release directory
          pkg                             # package directory
           pkg-debuginfo                  # package subdirectories
</pre>

<h4>Example using <a href="http://lftp.yar.ru/">lftp</a> to upload packages:</h4>

<h4>Example <tt>lftp</tt> upload command line</h4>

<pre>    From: Christopher Faylor
    To: cygwin-apps
    Subject: Re: The upload system is live (Re: Major changes coming to
            procedure for uploading to sourceware)
    Date: Thu, 17 Oct 2013 00:30:00 -0400

    I just used this command line to upload the time packages:

    cd wherever
    lftp -c 'connect sftp://cygwin@cygwin.com/; cd x86/release; mirror -eR time; put /dev/null -o !ready'

    FYI.

    cgf
</pre>

<p>The package directories should exactly mirror what is currently in
the release directory.  So, it should be a hierarchy containing
<tt>.tar.xz</tt> files and <tt>setup.hint</tt> files.</p>

<p>The <tt>!ready</tt> file is used to tell
<tt>calm</tt> (the script which creates setup.ini) that any files older
than this file in or under the given directory should be processed.  The
intent is that you create <tt>!ready</tt> when you have finished
uploading everything that you plan on uploading.</p>

<p><b>Note: <tt>!ready</tt> files should not be created in the root of your
upload directory</b>, i.e. they should be in the architecture
directories <tt>x86</tt>, <tt>x86_64</tt> and <tt>noarch</tt> or in the package
directories themselves.</p>

<p><tt>calm</tt> will periodically scan the upload directories for
packages that are ready, and, if there are no errors, move the packages
into the real release area.  New directories in the release area will be
created as needed.  If there are errors then <tt>setup.ini</tt> will not
be updated and the release area will remain pristine.</p>

<h2>Getting reports</h2>

<p>You can also create a <tt>!mail</tt> (or
<tt>!email</tt>) file which contains a list of email address (one per
line) where any <tt>calm</tt> reports on your packages should be sent.  If that isn't
specified then you won't get email when <tt>calm</tt> finds issues with what was
uploaded.  This file must be in the root of your upload directory.</p>

<h2 id="deleting">Removing files from the Cygwin distribution</h2>

Removing files is not normally needed, as old versions which aren't referenced
by <tt>setup.ini</tt>, and are thus are no longer installable, will be removed
periodically.

However, if you do need to remove a file from the distribution, upload an empty
file with the name of the file that you want deleted, prefixed with a
"<tt>-</tt>".

<p>For example, if you want to delete the file <tt>foo-1.2-1.tar.xz</tt> then upload an empty file named:<pre> -foo-1.2-1.tar.xz</pre></p>

<p>Note that files are not actually deleted; they are moved to a vault where they will be removed after some indeterminate amount of time.</p>

<h2 id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="stalled">Q) Why aren't my files being transferred to the release area?  I've waited
several days and don't see any movement.</h3>

<p>A) The package updater runs twice every hour, at 10 and 40 minutes past the hour so, if you don't see any movement
at, e.g., 20 minutes past the next hour, then your package is not going to be updated.</p>

<p>The main reason that this could happen is if you uploaded a package that
you are not actually responsible for.  The updater only knows what you
are responsible for based on <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint</a> so if
you aren't listed as an owner there your packages won't be updated.

<h3 id="cantlogin">Q) Why can't I login via sftp?</h3>
<p>A) There are two likely reasons for login failures:
<ol><li>You're not using the ssh key provided when you set up your account.</li>
<li>You are not logging in as the <tt>cygwin</tt> user.  You need to login as user <tt>cygwin</tt> with no password.</li>
</ol>
