<h1>What are the licensing terms?</h1>

<p>Most of the tools are covered by the GNU GPL, some are public domain,
and others have a X11 style license.  To cover the GNU GPL
requirements, the basic rule is if you give out any binaries, you must
also make the source available.  For the full details, be sure to read
the text of the <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
For more information on the GPL see the <a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a>.

<P>The Cygwin&trade; API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the
source code is also covered by the GNU GPL (with exceptions; see
below).  By default, all executables link against this library (and in
the process include GPL'd Cygwin&trade; glue code).  This means that unless
you modify the tools so that compiled executables do not make use of
the Cygwin&trade; library, your compiled programs will also have to be free
software distributed under the GPL with source code available to all.

<p>In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose
sources are distributed under a license that complies with the
Open Source Definition
[See <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/">http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/</a> for the precise Open Source Definition and a list of the licenses certified by OSI as conforming to that definition]
to be linked with libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll without libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll
itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.

<p>This means that you can port an Open Source application to Cygwin&trade;,
and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to
the Cygwin&trade; DLL itself.  If you distribute the Cygwin&trade; DLL,
either in its original form or in a form modified by you, you must adhere to
the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources for the Cygwin&trade; DLL
unless you have obtained a special Cygwin&trade; license to distribute the
Cygwin&trade; DLL in only its binary form (see below).

<p>Red Hat sells a special Cygwin&trade; License for customers who are unable to
provide their application in open source code form.  For more information,
please see:
