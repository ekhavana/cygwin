<h1 align=center>What are the licensing terms?</h1>

<p>Most of the tools are covered by the GNU GPL, some are public domain,
and others have a X11 style copyright.  To cover the GNU GPL
requirements, the basic rule is if you give out any binaries, you must
also make the source available.  For the full details, be sure to read
the text of the <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
For more information on the GPL see the <a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a>.

<P>The Cygwin API library found in the winsup subdirectory of the
source code is also covered by the GNU GPL (with exceptions; see
below).  By default, all executables link against this library (and in
the process include GPL'd Cygwin glue code).  This means that unless
you modify the tools so that compiled executables do not make use of
the Cygwin library, your compiled programs will also have to be free
software distributed under the GPL with source code available to all.

<p align=center>*** NOTE ***</p>

<p>In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose
sources are distributed under a license that complies with the Open
Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll without
libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll itself causing the resulting program to be covered
by the GNU GPL.

<p>This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a/cygwin1.dll linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to
the cygwin DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of
the DLL you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources
for the cygwin DLL.

<p>See <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/">http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/</a> for the precise Open Source
Definition referenced above.

<p>Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to
provide their application in open source code form.  For more information,
