<h1 align=center>How can I help out?</h1>

<P>Part of the time put into this project has been
paid for by Cygnus customers.  Some of the rest has been due to employees
volunteering many extra hours making these tools more viable.  And
we have also received a significant amount of help from the Net
community but we could definitely use more help!

<H2>Building the development version of Cygwin</H2>

<P>The code corresponding to cygwin1.dll is mostly in the winsup
directory with additional code coming from newlib/libc, newlib/libm,
libiberty, and gcc.  Any changes you make should ideally be made to
the <a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/noer/winsup-snapshot/">
current development sources</a>, available via ftp.  This makes it
much easier to integrate your changes once they're completed and
tested.  Note the development snapshots should compile, but they
should always be assumed to be unstable and contain untested,
experimental code.

<P>To build the Cygwin library, start by building the comp-tools sources
with the last release, substituting in the newlib and winsup sources
from the snapshot location.  Minimal build instructions are included in
the <a href="faq_toc.html">FAQ</a>.  If your object directory is /c/obj,
the Cygwin dll you will build should be /c/obj/winsup/new-cygwinxx.dll
where xx represents the current API_MAJOR version number.

<P>Once you have a built comp-tools tree, if you make further changes
to the winsup sources, you can rebuild the library by typing:

<blockquote>
	<tt>make all-target-winsup</tt>
</blockquote>

<P>Note that minimally, the top-level tree needs to contain:

<blockquote>
Makefile.in, config, config-ml.in, config.guess, config.sub, configure,
configure.in, include, install-sh, libiberty, ltconfig, ltmain.sh, missing,
move-if-change, newlib, symlink-tree, winsup, ylwrap.
</blockquote>

<P>So another method that might work would be to start with a
newlib and winsup snapshot and copy the missing pieces from the last
major release source tree.  You may also want to fix the EXE_LDFLAGS
variable in winsup/Makefile.in so that winsup/utils/ programs link
with the correct libcygwin.a.

<H2>Before you get started</H2>

<P>First, note that our team only maintains the winsup directory
(but can also make changes to newlib as well).  That said, feel
free to send us Cygwin-related patches for other tools -- we'll
probably know what you should do with them if we're not in the position
of making the change directly.

<P>If your change is going to be a significant one in terms of the size
of your code changes, be aware that you will have to sign over the
copyright ownership of your code changes to Cygnus or the FSF
(depending on the source file) before we can include your changes in
the main source tree.  Your employer may also have to send us a
disclaimer stating that they have no claims to your contribution.  This
is necessary for liability reasons.  Here is our
<a href="assign.txt">standard assignment form</a> for changes to
Cygwin that you can fill
out, sign, and send back.  It shouldn't end up being that much of a
pain.  If you have any questions, please send them to
<a href="mailto:cygwin32-developers@cygnus.com">cygwin32-developers@cygnus.com</a>.

<P>Finally, before you start modifying anything for real, you should
probably join the cygwin32-developers mailing list and send it mail
describing what you want to do and how you want to do it so you
don't waste time working on something we can't integrate.  This also
allows us to keep track of what's being worked on so efforts aren't
duplicated.

<P>Once you've finished making and testing your changes, you should send
a context diff to the cygwin32-developers list.  As an example, if you
modified winsup/syscalls.cc and have the original source file around
as /winsup/syscalls.cc-orig, you would do the following in bash:

<p>
<pre>
      cd /c/src/winsup <br>
      diff -cp syscalls.cc-orig syscalls.cc > syscalls.cc-patch 2>&1 <br>
</pre>

<P>Then gzip and uuencode it and send it to the cygwin32-developers list
in an email along with an explanation of what the change does.  This
must include a ChangeLog entry (model yours after other entries in the
file winsup/ChangeLog).  Then we'll test it and get back to you as
soon as we can.

<P>Please feel free to ask me any questions about any of this.  I
would love it if more people made useful contributions -- this can be
one of the big advantages of free software; we all benefit from
everyone else's work as well as our own...

<H2>What needs doing:</H2>

<P>A fair amount of stuff.  Hopefully it will be listed here soon...

<P>You can get a good idea of the current bugs and problem areas by
browsing the gnu-win32 mailing list archives.  In addition, check out
the API calls portion of the FAQ and look for references to
unimplemented functions.  Or send mail to <a
href="mailto:cygwin32-developers@cygnus.com">cygwin32-developers@cygnus.com</a>
and see what people suggest...
