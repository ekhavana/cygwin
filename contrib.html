<h1 align=center>How can I help out?</h1>

<P>Part of the time put into this project has been
paid for by Cygnus customers.  Some of the rest has been due to employees
volunteering many extra hours making these tools more viable.  And
we have also received a significant amount of help from the Net
community but we could definitely use more help!

<H2>Building the development version of Cygwin</H2>

<P>The code corresponding to cygwin1.dll is mostly in the winsup
directory with additional code coming from newlib/libc, newlib/libm,
libiberty, and include.  Any changes you make should ideally be made to the
<a href="cvs.html">current development sources</a>.  This makes it much
easier to integrate your changes once they're completed and tested.
Note that the current CVS tree (and the development snapshots) should
compile, but they should always be assumed to be unstable since they contain
untested, experimental code.

<P>Minimal build instructions are included in the <a
href="faq/">FAQ</a>.  If your object directory is /c/obj, the Cygwin dll
you will build should be /c/obj/winsup/new-cygwinxx.dll where xx
represents the current API_MAJOR version number.

<P>Note that minimally, the top-level source tree needs to contain:

<blockquote>
Makefile.in, config, config-ml.in, config.guess, config.sub, configure,
configure.in, include, install-sh, libiberty, ltconfig, ltmain.sh, missing,
move-if-change, newlib, symlink-tree, winsup, ylwrap.
</blockquote>

<H2>Before you get started</H2>

<P>First, note that our team only maintains the winsup directory
(but can also make changes to newlib as well).  That said, feel
free to send us Cygwin-related patches for other tools -- we'll
probably know what you should do with them if we're not in the position
of making the change directly.

<P>If your change is going to be a significant one in terms of the
size of your code changes, be aware that you will have to sign over
the copyright ownership of your code changes to Cygnus or the FSF
(depending on the source file) before we can include your changes in
the main source tree.  Your employer may also have to send us a
disclaimer stating that they have no claims to your contribution.
This is necessary for liability reasons.  Here is our <a
href="assign.txt">standard assignment form</a> for changes to Cygwin
that you can fill out, sign, and send back.  It shouldn't end up being
that much of a pain.  If you have any questions, please send them to
<a
href="mailto:cygwin@cygwin.com">cygwin@cygwin.com</a>.

<P>Finally, before you start modifying anything for real, you should
probably join the cygwin-developers mailing list and send it mail
describing what you want to do and how you want to do it so you
don't waste time working on something we can't integrate.  This also
allows us to keep track of what's being worked on so efforts aren't
duplicated.

<P>Once you've finished making and testing your changes, you should send
a context diff to the cygwin-patches list.  As an example, if you
modified winsup/syscalls.cc and have the original source file around
as /winsup/syscalls.cc-orig, you would do the following in bash:

<p>
<pre>
      cd /c/src/winsup <br>
      diff -up syscalls.cc-orig syscalls.cc &gt; syscalls.cc-patch 2&gt;&1 <br>
</pre>

<P>Then send it to the cygwin-patches list in an email along with an
explanation of what the change does.  This must include a ChangeLog
entry.  If you have never used a ChangeLog before 1) refer to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_39.html">GNU ChangeLog
Standards</a> and 2) model your entry after other entries in the file
winsup/ChangeLog.</p>

<p>Common submission problems to cygwin-patches include:
<ul>
<li>Submissions without a ChangeLog.
<li>Improper ChangeLog formatting:
<ul>
<li>Missing function names (e.g., "* foo.cc: Don't increment x if y is negative").
<li>Strange formatting (e.g., extra spaces or too many blank lines).
<li>Wrong "tense" (e.g., "Added one to x" rather than "Add one to x").
<li>Incorrect use of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_40.html">continuation</a>
with lists of functions.
</ul>
<li>Diffs sent in uuencoded or otherwise encrypted fashion.
<li>Diffs sent in improper form:
<ul>
<li>Not "unidiff" format (i.e., no -u).
<li>Missing function names (i.e., no -p).
<li>Not an actual patch! (e.g., "I changed line 27 of foo.cc to this:")
</ul>
</ul>

<P>Note that you must be subscribed to cygwin-developers and
cygwin-patches to send email to those lists.  If you have a <b>small</b>
patch for Cygwin and don't intend to contribute to ongoing development,
it is not necessary to send your patch to the cygwin-patches mailing
list.  Instead, you may try your luck on the general cygwin mailing
list.  The responsible parties at Cygnus read the cygwin mailing list so
they will eventually see your proposed change.</p>

<P>Please feel free to ask questions about any of this.  We
would love it if more people made useful contributions -- this can be
one of the big advantages of free software; we all benefit from
everyone else's work as well as our own...</p>

<H2>What needs doing:</H2>

<P>There is a to-do list <a href="cygwin-todo.cgi">here</a>.

<P>You can also get a good idea of the current bugs and problem areas by
browsing the cygwin mailing list archives.  In addition, check out the
API calls portion of the FAQ and look for references to unimplemented
functions.  Or send mail to <a
href="mailto:cygwin-developers@cygwin.com">cygwin-developers@cygwin.com</a>
and see what people suggest.  Please be advised that this list is intended only for
people who are serious about augmenting the cygwin DLL.  It is not intended as a
vehicle for getting your general cygwin questions answered or for announcing ports of
any associated Cygwin utilities.  You will first have to join the
list before you are able to send email.
