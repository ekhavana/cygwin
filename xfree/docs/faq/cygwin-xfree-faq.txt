1. General Information

   1.1. What is Cygwin/X?

   Cygwin/X is a port of the X Window System to Cygwin; Cygwin provides a
   UNIX-like API on the Win32 platform.

   1.2. What is Cygwin?

   Cygwin tools are, in the words of the [91]Cygwin homepage, "ports of
   the popular GNU development tools and utilities for Windows 95, 98,
   and NT. They function by using the Cygwin library which provides a
   UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API." Cygwin provides the compiler
   (gcc), libraries, headers, and other utilities which build and support
   the operation of Cygwin/X.

   1.3. What is the X Window System?

   [ScheiflerGettys92]

   The X Window System, or X, is a network-transparent window system.
   With X, multiple applications can run simultaneously in windows,
   generating text and graphics in monochrome or color on a bitmap
   display. Network transparency means that application programs can run
   on machines scattered through the network.

   1.4. What is an X Server?

   An X Server is a program that provides display and user input services
   to other programs. In comparison, a file server provides other
   programs with access to file storage devices. File servers are
   typically located in a remote location and you use the services of a
   file server from the machine that you are located at. In contrast, an
   X Server is typically running on the machine that you are located at;
   display and user input services may be requested by programs running
   on your machine, as well as by programs running on remote machines.

   1.5. What is an X client?

   An X client is a program that utilizes the display and user input
   services provided by an X Server. X clients may run on the same or
   disparate machine as the X Server that is providing display and user
   input services.

   1.6. Why port the X Window System to Microsoft Windows?

   Porting X Window System to Microsoft Windows benefits many people and
   projects in many ways:
     * Prior to Cygwin/X only commercial, closed source X Servers were
       available for Microsoft Windows.
     * An X Server on Windows may be used to display the output of
       programs running on remote UNIX machines.
     * Cygwin/X, in conjunction with Cygwin, provides a complete
       compatibility layer for compiling and running UNIX applications on
       Microsoft Windows.

   1.7. Is there a Cygwin/X newsgroup?

   No, Cygwin/X does not have a newsgroup; however, we do have a mailing
   list. See [92]Q: 1.8.

   1.8. Is there a Cygwin/X mailing list?

   Yes, Cygwin/X has a mailing list, namely, cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com.
   Visit the [93]Cygwin Mailing Lists page to subscribe to
   cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com as well as to read and search an online
   archive of the mailing list traffic.

     Tip: Post your X-related inquires to cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com only;
     do not post nor cross post your inquires to the cygwin@cygwin.com
     mailing list. Cygwin's mailing list is only for Cygwin API related
     inquires that are not handled by another more-specific list.

2. Installation

   2.1. What versions of Windows does Cygwin/X run on?

   Cygwin/X supports Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0,
   Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 as of 2003-12-29.

   Cygwin/X requires Cygwin to compile and run. Cygwin is not, as of
   2003-12-29, available on Microsoft Windows CE, therefore Cygwin/X is
   not currently available on Microsoft Windows CE.

   2.2. How is Cygwin/X installed?

   The [94]Cygwin/X User's Guide thoroughly documents the installation
   process. Installation is performed through Cygwin's setup.exe program.

3. Configuration

   3.1. Is there an XF86Config file?

   The configfile support was only limited. Because of this and extra
   dependencies it was removed again. But most of the options which were
   configurable in the configfile are now available as commandline
   options. For more information on configuring other keyboard layout see
   [95]Q: 4.1.1.

   3.2. What are the command line arguments for XWin.exe?

   The [96]Cygwin/X User's Guide documents the command line arguments for
   XWin.exe.

   3.3. Why does XWin.exe ignore the display depth that I pass on the
   command line?

   When running in windowed mode or GDI-based fullscreen mode, XWin.exe
   must run the X Server at whatever display depth Windows is currently
   using; in these cases the display depth passed on the command line is
   ignored. XWin.exe only uses the display depth parameter when running
   in a DirectDraw-based fullscreen mode, as DirectDraw allows
   applications to change the display resolution and depth when running
   in fullscreen mode.

   3.4. I have a two button mouse, can I emulate a three button mouse?

   Yes. Pass the -emulate3buttons timeout_in_milliseconds parameter to
   XWin.exe, where timeout_in_milliseconds is the, optional, maximum
   number of milliseconds between a button release and opposite button
   press that will trigger an emulated third button press.

   3.5. Is there a Focus-Follows-Mouse feature (Auto-Focus)?

   This is a setting of the windowmanager used. The default windowmanager
   twm has no such feature. But with fvwm2 this can be achieved with the
   this configuration entry:
   Focus FocusFollowsMouse

   Other windowmanagers (eg. windowmaker) have similar features too.

   3.6. The option -nounixkill has no effect. How can i prevent the
   server shutdown an Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace?

   There is a keybinding to Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace which is named
   TerminateServer. Remove this binding and Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace will have
   no effect.
   xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"

4. Internationalization

4.1. Keyboard support

   4.1.1. How do I use a non-U.S. keyboard layout?

   Some keyboard layouts are configured according to the Windows keyboard
   settings. For these layouts no special change is needed. For all other
   layouts there is the possibility to configure the layout via
   commandline options.

   The mainoption for changing the layout is -xkblayout countrycode where
   countrycode is in most cases the 2 character code which also
   represents the country in internet adresses (e.g. Australia = au,
   Deutschland = de, France = fr, Japan = jp, United Kingdom = uk).

   Other options for tweaking the XKB layout are -xkbmodel,-xkbvariant,
   -xkboptions and -xkbrules. These are the counterparts for the similar
   named options known from the XF86Config file.

   If the loading fails, check [97]Q: 4.1.5.

   4.1.2. Where can I find an xmodmap for my non-U.S. keyboard layout?

   You can try using an xmodmap file for your keyboard layout from a
   GNU/Linux distribution (e.g. RedHat).

   Or, you can use xkeycaps to automatically generate a modmap for one of
   over 208 different layouts. See the [98]xkeycaps home page to download
   and for more information.

   4.1.3. How do I get my non-U.S. keyboard modmap to be installed when
   using xdmcp?

   See [99]Q: 4.1.1.

   4.1.4. Logging into AIX via XDMCP causes the keyboard to function as
   if AltGr is permanently pressed.

   [Pavel Rybnicek] The X Keyboard Extension doesn't work with AIX. The X
   Keyboard Extension is enabled by default, so you must disable it with
   the -kb parameter. An example command line follows.

   XWin.exe -kb -query aix_hostname_or_ip_address

   4.1.5. Loading XKB keymaps fails

   First check if you are able to change the server to another layout via
   XKB. The german layout will be good for testing:
   setxkbmap de -model pc105

   This worked if pressing "Shift" and "8" produces "(" instead of "*".
   If it worked then you can skip the next paragraph.

   There is currently a problem with the /tmp directory mounted in
   textmode. You can change the setting to binmode with:
   mount -b "$(cygpath -m /tmp)" /tmp

   If this fails with an errormessage stating unsufficient rights, try
   mount -b -u "$(cygpath -m /tmp)" /tmp

   Not all keyboard layouts are tested very well and some contain errors
   or do not work at all. To test if the compiling of your layout works
   start
   xkbcomp -w 3 -xkm -m de /etc/X11/xkb/keymap/xfree86 localhost:0.0

   (replace the "de" with your layout code). This may produce warnings,
   but must not produce errors. If there are errors then please report
   them to the mailinglist.

   4.1.6. I have Windows XP with Powertoys installed and AltGr does not
   work. What can I do?

   This problem is solved in recent Cygwin/X releases. Use cygwin setup
   to upgrade the XFree86-xserv package.

   4.1.7. AltGr does not work properly when connecting to other unices or
   to old XFree86.

   The older X11 releases on the various commercial unices define the
   AltGr key as ModeSwitch, MetaR, AltR or similar. Cygwin/X expects it
   to be ISO_Level3_Switch. For reasons unknown to us this is reset when
   loggin into the remote host. As far as we don't have access to such a
   machine we are unable to track this down and find a reason.

   Sometimes it does help to run
   DISPLAY=:0.0 setxkbmap languagecode

   from a cygwin shell. For more information see [100]Q: 4.1.1..

4.2. Display problems

   4.2.1. How do I get bash to display accents and/or umlauts?

   (Heinz Peter Hippenstiel) Add the following lines to .inputrc in your
   Cygwin home directory (e.g. /home/harold/):
set meta-flag on
set output-meta on # to show 8-bit characters
set convert-meta off # to show it as character, not the octal representation

# Mapping for German umlauts
"\M-a": "ä"
"\M-A": "Ä"
"\M-o": "ö"
"\M-O": "Ö"
"\M-u": "ü"
"\M-U": "Ü"
"\M-s": "ß"
# (TODO: Mapping for accents?)

   4.2.2. How do I put bash into "8 bit" mode?

   See [101]Q: 4.2.1.

5. Remote connections

   5.1. X11Forwarding does not work with openssh

   Before establishing the ssh connection the xserver must be started and
   the environment variable DISPLAY must be set for ssh.
$ DISPLAY=localhost:0.0
$ export DISPLAY
$ ssh -X remotehost

   or
   $ DISPLAY=localhost:0.0 ssh -X remotehost

   Make sure you're not starting ssh with the parameter -x. This disables
   [102]X11Forwarding. The correct parameter is -X (uppercase).

   Check that X11Forwarding is not disabled in the openssh client
   configuration. The configfiles are by default ~/.ssh/config and
   /etc/ssh_config. The file in the home directory overrides settings in
   the global one. The configfile is split into various sections starting
   with "Host wildcard". The section applies to all hosts where wildcard
   matches the hostname. If this section contains an entry "ForwardX11
   no" then X11Forwarding is disabled. To enable it change the entry to
   ForwardX11 yes

   Starting with OpenSSH 3.8 you will need the switch "ForwardX11Trusted
   yes" in the client configuration to allow remote clients full access
   to the xserver. Without it some clients will fail with a similar
   error:
 X Error of failed request: BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request: 18 (X_ChangeProperty)
  Atom id in failed request: 0x114
  Serial number of failed request: 370
  Current serial number in output stream: 372

   Check that X11Forwarding is not disabled in the ssh server
   configuration. The configfile is by default /etc/ssh/ssh_config. If
   there is an entry "X11Forwarding no" then X11Forwarding is disabled.
   If you have write access to the config file then change it to
   X11Forwarding yes

   Otherwise ask your you admin to change this for you.

6. XDMCP connections

   6.1. XDMCP fatal error: Session declined No valid address

   Cygwin/X is sometimes unable to determine which local network
   interface's address should be reported to the [103]XDMCP server; in
   these cases you need to pass -from local_host_name_or_ip_address to
   XWin.exe to specify which interface address to report.

   6.2. I get no login screen when using -query

   [Mika Laitio] For security reasons, XDMCP is not enabled by default on
   most Linux/UNIX/*NIX/*BSD distributions (RedHat, Mandrake, SuSE,
   FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.) by default. You have to manually enable remote
   logins to your X Display Manager (xdm, kdm, or gdm). The location of
   the proper config file is distribution/OS dependent, but a short list
   of known config file locations is given in [104]Table 1. You must
   change the line:
[Xdmcp]
Enable=false

   to:
[Xdmcp]
Enable=true

   Table 1. Known XDM Configuration File Locations
   Distribution/OS  Version  Display Manager          Location
   Linux Mandrake   8.1      kdm             /usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc
   Debian GNU/Linux Unstable kdm             /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc
   Debian GNU/Linux Unstable gdm             /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf

   XDMCP will not work correctly if you have a personal firewall
   installed or the built-in firewall of Windows is activated.

   The XDMCP protocol will send and receive data on port 177/UDP. But the
   actual connections will be made to the local port 6000/TCP. It is safe
   to allow connections since the xserver has an own security layer. An
   overview of used ports is given in [105]Table 2.

   Table 2. Ports used with XDMCP connections
   Port Protocol Direction Comment
   177 UDP Incoming/Outgoing Actual XDMCP connection
   6000+display TCP Incoming Connection for X11 clients. display is
   usally 0 except you specify it on the commandline.

   6.3. I get no login screen for Solaris

   See also [106]Q: 6.4. and [107]Q: 6.5.

   [David Dawson] For whatever reason, certain versions of Solaris need
   fonts that are not provided by Cygwin/X; the result is that you may
   see the Solaris background tile and the hourglass cursor, but the XDM
   login prompt will never appear. The simplest solution is to point
   Cygwin/X at the font server that is usually running on the Solaris
   machine. You'll need a command line similar to the following to start
   your XDMCP session and to connect to the Solaris font server:

   XWin.exe -query solaris_hostname_or_ip_address -fp
   tcp/solaris_hostname_or_ip_address:7100

     Note: The -fp parameter is a general X Server parameter, it is not
     specific to Cygwin/X; therefore, the -fp is documented in the
     [108]X Server documentation. For additional information about
     fonts, see [109]Fonts in XFree86.

   The standard port number for a font server is 7100, however, you may
   need to ask your system administrator what the font server port number
   is if you cannot connect to a font server on port 7100. It is also
   possible that your Solaris machine is not running a font server, in
   which case you will need to consult your Solaris documentation for
   instructions on how to run a font server.

   6.4. XDMCP freezes with remote Solaris machine!

   See also [110]Q: 6.3. and [111]Q: 6.5.

   Solaris appears to not support certain display bit depths, such as 24
   bits per pixel. Change your Windows display bit depth to 8, 16, or 32
   and try logging in again. File a complaint with Sun if this issue is
   important to you, or change your Solaris machines to use XFree86
   instead of the Solaris X Window System.

   6.5. Login to CDE on Solaris via XDMCP hangs Cygwin/X.

   See also [112]Q: 6.3. and [113]Q: 6.4.

   Install the [114]recommended set of patches for your version of
   Solaris.

   6.6. Where can I find more information about XDMCP.

   See the [115]Linux XDMCP HOWTO for more information about XDMCP.

7. Troubleshooting

   7.1. Is there a log file that I can look at for diagnostic information
   and error messages?

   Yes. The Cygwin/X log file is located at /tmp/XWin.log. You will find
   solutions to the most common error messages in [116]the Section called
   Error and Warning Messages.

   7.2. I have a specific error message, what does it mean?

   See the Error and Warning Messages section for help with specific
   error messages. Return to this section if you do not find a specific
   answer for the error message that you have.

   7.3. I have a specific error message that is not addressed in the
   Error and Warning Messages section.

   Search the [117]Cygwin/X mailing list archives to see if the error
   message has already been reported and/or addressed. Report the error
   message to the [118]Cygwin/X mailing list, how the error message was
   caused, and the behavior of the X Server after the error message was
   generated (exit, freeze, etc.), only if the error message has not been
   reported, if the circumstances that produced the error message are
   significantly different from other reports, or if you have additional
   information regarding the error message to contribute.

   7.4. My bug report the Cygwin/X mailing list was ignored. What do I do
   now?

   Some bug reports are deliberately ignored by project members if the
   bug in question was recently dealt with; did you [119]search the
   mailing list archives for a solution to your problem before submitting
   your bug report? Some bug reports are ignored if they do not contain
   sufficient information to understand the situation that produces the
   bug; did your bug report have enough information? Some bug reports are
   missed or forgotten, thus some valid bug reports do not receive a
   reply; simply resubmit such bug reports that have not received a
   response within 7 days of submission.

   7.5. Cygwin/X has very poor performance. What's the reason?

   Most likely you have installed some kind of personal firewall, VPN
   software or any other software that modifies the TCP/IP stack of
   Windows. Especially Webwasher and some other filtering software are
   known to slow down the network traffic.

   [Dr. Edward Wornar] Certain programs that are installed by various
   drivers and software packages can consume an incredible amount of
   system resources and processing time. One known example of such a
   program is ATI2evxx.exe, a utility installed with some ATI
   Technologies graphics card drivers. [120]Answers That Work has
   information on ATI2evxx.exe on their [121]Task List Programs - A page.
   You may want to try disabling, one-by-one, ATI2evxx.exe and other such
   programs until you find the program that is causing the slowdown.

   7.6. I have Microsoft Services for Unix installed and can't type
   anything. Help me!!!

   Microsoft Services for Unix set some environment variables which
   points Cygwin/X to outdated or not existing files. These variables are
XAPPLRESDIR
XCMSDB
XKEYSYMDB
XNLSPATH

   To have Cygwin/X work correctly you have to unset at least XKEYSYMDB.

   Reported by Juan Medina, Pavel Rozenboim

   7.7. Cygwin/X is extremely slow, especially when using XDMCP to
   connect to remote machines.

   see [122]Q: 7.5..

8. Error and Warning Messages

   8.1. IBM ThinkPad's with a TrackPoint mouse doesn't allow simulated
   mouse wheel scrolling.

   [Gerald S. Williams] The TrackPoint driver tries to send scroll
   up/down messages to the default scrollbar in a window. Cygwin/X does
   not use Windows scrollbars for X Client windows, so we must configure
   the TrackPoint driver to send standard WM_MOUSEWHEEL messages to the
   Cygwin/X window. This can be done by editing the TrackPoint
   configuration file that can be found either in
   %SYSTEM_ROOT%\System32\tp4table.dat or
   %SYSTEM_ROOT%\System32\tp4scrol.dat. Add the following to the "Pass 0
   rules"section:
; X Windows
*,*,XWin.exe,*,*,cygwin/xfree86,WheelStd,0,9

   8.2. A required DLL file: cygncurses5.dll cannot be found

   Upgrading from ncurses-5.2-5 to ncurses-5.2-7 requires following some
   [123]special instructions; failure to follow those instructions will
   cause the above error message when running various Cygwin and Cygwin/X
   programs.

   8.3. _XSERVTransmkdir: Owner of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to root

   This warning message can be ignored; it does not cause any known
   problems.

   8.4. error opening security policy file
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy

   From [124]http://xfree86.org/, "This is a only a warning message, and
   is mostly harmless. If your server is failing to startup, this is not
   the reason. Check the other messages."

   8.5. Fatal server error: could not open default font 'fixed'

   Nudge the mailing list if a new answer is not provided by 2003/01/31.

   8.6. Could not init font path element /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/*/,
   removing from list!

   See [125]Q: 8.5..

   8.7. The procedure entry point _check_for_executable could not be
   located

   Programs that you are attempting to use were compiled against a newer
   version of Cygwin than is currently on your system. Run Cygwin's setup
   program to update your installation to the latest version.

   8.8. Exception: STATUS_INTEGER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO

   You are most likely running your primary Windows display at a bit
   depth that requires palettized color, most likely 8 bits per pixel, in
   conjunction with a release of Cygwin/X that does not support
   palettized color modes. Palettized color support was added to Cygwin/X
   on 2001-06-05. You may either install a newer version of Cygwin/X that
   supports palettized color, or you may run your primary Windows display
   at 15, 16, 24, or 32 bits per pixel.

   See [126]Q: 8.9.

   8.9. Exception: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION

   cygwin1.dll uses a shared memory section amongst all loaded copies of
   cygwin1.dll; unfortunately, the layout and usage of the shared memory
   section changes between versions of cygwin1.dll. Loading two different
   versions of cygwin1.dll will cause the shared memory section to become
   corrupted, which almost always results in an Exception:
   STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION. You must search your filesystem(s) and remove
   all copies of cygwin1.dll except the copy in /bin. You must remove the
   different versions of cygwin1.dll even if they are not in your path,
   as programs that depend on cygwin1.dll attempt to load the file from
   the local directory before searching other paths; thus, it is rather
   easy, and common, for multiple versions of cygwin1.dll to become
   loaded at the same time if they exist on a particular system.

   8.10. Xlib: connection to "local_host_name_or_ip_address:0.0" refused
   by server Xlib: Maximum number of clients reached

   Cygwin/X queries getdtablesize () for the maximum number of client
   connections allowed; by default Cygwin returns 32 from getdtablesize
   (). Cygwin/X [127]Server Test Series release [128]Test44, released on
   2001-08-15, changes the maximum number of clients from 32 to 1024 by
   passing the square of getdtablesize () to setdtablesize ().

   8.11. XIO: fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) on X server
   "127.0.0.1:0.0"

   See [129]Q: 8.10.

   8.12. Cannot Open Display: 127.0.0.1:0.0

   Certain classes of software, such as that used for [130]Virtual
   Private Networking and [131]fire-walling may cause the IP address
   127.0.0.1, or other local adapter addresses, to be redirected, to
   become inoperable in some way, or to be operated in a manner that
   violates the defined operation of IP address.

   As a potential remedy, try removing all instances of such software;
   this may not always fix the problem though, as some software may leave
   artifacts even after uninstallation is completed. The only way to be
   sure that you have not found a Cygwin/X bug is to install Windows on a
   freshly formatted hard drive, followed by Cygwin and Cygwin/X, and
   finally add your other software one application at a time until
   Cygwin/X stops working.

   Some products that have been reported to cause problems:

     Note: These products may not cause problems in all configurations.
     However, the Cygwin/X project has neither the time, ability, nor
     resources to help you correctly configure your third-party
     software.

     * Aventail Connect
     * Zonealarm PC Firewall from Zonelab

   8.13. Fatal server error: negative sized edge?

   A compilation bug, due to the -ansi build flag, in the Type1 font
   library caused this bug to be present in all Cygwin/X XWin.exe builds
   between 2001-05-06 and 2001-08-03. The -ansi build flag was removed on
   2001-08-03 and subsequent builds do not contain the bug. All Server
   Test Series releases from Test23 to Test41 contain the bug. Test42 was
   the first recent Server Test Series release that did not contain the
   bug. Remedy the bug by either installing the most recent Server Test
   Series release or by updating your entire Cygwin/X installation.

   8.14. Out of environment space

   Increase your Windows environment space by following the
   [132]instructions provided by Microsoft.

   8.15. Too many parameters

   See [133]Q: 8.14.

9. Porting Software

   9.1. Is there a list of software that has been ported to Cygwin/X?

   Yes, see the [134]Cygwin/X - Ported Software page.

   9.2. How do I start porting software to Cygwin/X?

   Cygwin/X provides a software interface that is very similar to the
   software interface provided by GNU/Linux and other UNIX systems. Most
   software packages will compile on Cygwin/X without any changes at all.
   To begin with, try to compile a given software package following that
   package's compilation instructions for GNU/Linux.

   9.3. Are there common problems encountered when porting software to
   Cygwin/X?

   One common problem encountered when porting software to Cygwin/X is
   due to Cygwin's inability to distinguish between files with the same
   name but different capitalization (e.g. XvMC.h and xvmc.h), which is
   due to a Windows' limitation.

   Example 1. Include Problems

   This example is based off an error that actually occurred in the
   XFree86 source code tree in xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/xvmc.c. xvmc.c
   included XvMC.h, as shown below:
   #include "XvMC.h"

   The intention was to include the file xc/include/extensions/XvMC.h.
   Unfortunately, there was a file named xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/xvmc.h
   that ended up getting included instead of the desired file, because
   the precompiler searched the local directory,
   xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/, before searching the rest of the include
   path. Cygwin can't distinguish between XvMC.h and xvmc.h, so xvmc.h
   ended up being included in xvmc.c. The build process on Cygwin broke
   because the contents of XvMC.h were entirely different than the
   contents of xvmc.h.

   The solution was to change the include to specifically reference the
   desired header:
   #include "../../../include/extensions/XvMC.h"

10. Contributing

   10.1. Are there step-by-step instructions for contributing to
   Cygwin/X?

   Yes. The [135]Cygwin/X Contributor's Guide has step-by-step
   instructions for obtaining the source, building the source, building
   debug versions of the source, and even cross-compiling under Linux.

   10.2. Are there editors for Windows that understand and preserve UNIX
   end of line characters?

   Yes. Emacs and XEmacs are available for Windows; they both understand
   and preserve UNIX end of line characters.

   10.3. How should I generate patches for Cygwin/X?

   Only submit patches that have UNIX end of line characters. See [136]Q:
   10.2. for information on editors for Windows that are aware of UNIX
   end of line characters.

   Generally it is better for us if you generate your patches against the
   X.org CVS tree. For example, run cvs -z4 diff -U3 hw/xwin/ from
   xc/programs/Xserver/ to generate a diff file for all the modified
   files in hw/xwin/. CVS is smart enough to only generate diffs for
   files that are in the CVS repository; for example, CVS diff will not
   create diffs for Emacs temporary files.

   In the case that you have modified a single file, create the diff with
   cvs -z4 diff -U3 file_name.

   10.4. Where do I submit patches for Cygwin/X?

   Submit patches for Cygwin/X to the cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com mailing
   list.

   See [137]Q: 10.3. for more information on generating patches.

   10.5. Why doesn't the X Window System use GNU's autoconf?

   The X Window System does not use autoconf because autoconf was not
   available when the X Window System was started in 1984.

   10.6. What compiler does Cygwin/X use, and which compilers are
   supported?

   Cygwin/X uses the gcc compiler from the Free Software Foundation.
   Cygwin/X source code is mostly ANSI C compliant, but we cannot
   guarantee that Cygwin/X will compile with any other compiler, nor can
   we afford the time to support compilers other than gcc.

   See the [138]GCC Home Page for more information on gcc.

   10.7. Is cross-compiling from a non-Cygwin platform supported?

   Cross-compiling from a non-Cygwin platform is described in the
   [139]Cygwin/X Contributor's Guide

   10.8. Where can I get help for installing DocBook on Cygwin?

   See [140]SGML for Windows NT: Setting up a free SGML editing and
   publishing system on Windows NT/Cygwin by Markus Hoenicka.

11. Licenses, Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights

   11.1. What licenses apply to Cygwin/X source code?

   Cygwin/X proper isn't covered by a single license, as Cygwin/X is made
   up of two parts that are covered by distinct licenses: Cygwin and the
   X Window System.

   See [141]Q: 11.2. and [142]Q: 11.3. for more information regarding the
   licenses that apply to Cygwin/X.

   11.2. What licenses apply to the X Window System source code?

   XFree86 source code is generally licensed under an [143]X11 style
   license, which is [144]certified by the Free Software Foundation as
   compatible with the GNU GPL.

   11.3. What license applies to Cygwin source code?

   Cygwin source code is licensed under a modified version of the GNU
   GPL. Cygwin's license modification specifically allows third-party
   software under an open source license to be linked with Cygwin without
   requiring that the source code for the third-party software be
   distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. Cygwin's developers went
   to great trouble to obtain this modification and should be thanked for
   doing so, as without it the modification, Cygwin/X linking to Cygwin
   would be the subject of endless discussion.

   11.4. Whom holds the copyright on the Cygwin/X source code?

   Cygwin/X proper doesn't have a single copyright holder, as Cygwin/X is
   made up of two parts, namely Cygwin and the X Window System; each part
   follows a different scheme in regards to whom will hold the copyright
   on source code.

   See [145]Q: 11.5. and [146]Q: 11.6. for more information regarding
   whom holds the copyright on Cygwin/X source code.

   11.5. Whom holds the copyright on the X Window System source code?

   Each source code file in the X Window System typically has its own
   license and copyright statement. Therefore, there is not a general
   rule for determining whom holds the copyright on a particular X Window
   System source file, as each author is free to assign the copyright to
   someone else, to some group, or to keep the copyright themselves. You
   must inspect the source code file in question to determine whom holds
   the copyright for that file.

   11.6. Whom holds the copyright on the Cygwin source code?

   [147]RedHat owns the copyright on the Cygwin source code. RedHat
   requires that copyright be assigned to RedHat for non-trivial changes
   to Cygwin. You must fill out a copyright transfer form if you are
   going to contribute substantial changes to Cygwin.

   11.7. What license applies to Motif?

   Motif is a closed source product produced by [148]The Open Group.
   However, The Open Group released [149]Open Motif on 2000-05-15 under a
   public license, [150]The Open Group Public License, that allows Open
   Motif to be distributed with and used on Open Source platforms. As of
   2001-07-10, Cygwin/X does not qualify as a platform that Open Motif
   can be distributed with and used on. However, the [151]Open Motif FAQ
   states, "[...] we hope to be able to make a distribution under a
   license complying with the Open Source guidelines sometime in the
   future. For now this is as close as to Open Source as we could get."

   11.8. Isn't "XWin" trademarked by StarNet Communications?

   No. A quick search at the [152]United States Patent and Trademark
   Office for "XWin" turns up one dead record and one live record. The
   live record is for a logo belonging to a rock crusher manufacturer
   based out of Belgium. Neither trademark affects Cygwin/X, as the dead
   record is no longer enforceable, while the live record is in an
   unrelated and distinct industry; there cannot be confusion between
   rock crushers and computer programs.

Glossary

F

   firewall
          Firewall software attempts to protect an internal network from
          intrusions originating from an external network.

V

   Virtual Private Network (VPN)
          Virtual Private Networks are encrypted tunnels through which
          private data can be safely transmitted over a private network
          (e.g. the Internet).

X

   X Display Manager (XDM)
          An X Display Manager presents a graphical login screen to X
          users. Often an XDM will allow the user to select a desktop
          environment or window manager to be for their login session.
          Some X Display Managers are xdm, gdm (Gnome Display Manager),
          and kdm (KDE Display Manager).

   X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)
          XDMCP allows XDM to process logins for users remote to the
          machine that XDM is running on; login sessions will be run on
          the machine running XDM. For example, at a university you may
          use XDMCP to login to an X session running on an engineering
          department computer from your dorm room.

          See Also: [153]X Display Manager.

   X11 Forwarding
          Some SSH programs like OpenSSH provide a feature where in
          addition to the normal text channel opened between the local
          and the remote host another encrypted channel is opened for the
          communication between the X11 client and the X11 server. The
          SSH server will act as proxy-server for the X11 clients and
          will forward all communication to the X11 server.

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [154]http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
