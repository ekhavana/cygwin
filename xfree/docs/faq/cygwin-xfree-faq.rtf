General Information\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 1.1. \b0 What is Cygwin/XFree86?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Cygwin/XFree86 is a port of XFree86 to Cygwin; Cygwin provides a UNIX-like API on the Win32 platform. At the time of writing, supported Win32 platforms are Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. Windows CE, Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11, and Windows NT 3.51 are not supported.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.2. \b0 What is Cygwin?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Cygwin tools are, in the words of the Cygwin homepage (http://cygwin.com/), \'93ports of the popular GNU development tools and utilities for Windows 95, 98, and NT. They function by using the Cygwin library which provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API.\'94 Cygwin provides the compiler (gcc), libraries, headers, and other utilities which build and support the operation of Cygwin/XFree86.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.3. \b0 What is the X Window System\'ae?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 [ScheiflerGettys92]\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \lang1033 The X Window System, or X, is a network-transparent window system. With X, multiple applications can run simultaneously in windows, generating text and graphics in monochrome or color on a bitmap display. Network transparency means that application programs can run on machines scattered through the network.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b\lang1024 1.4. \b0 What is XFree86?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 XFree86, in the words of the XFree86 homepage, is \'93a freely redistributable open-source implementation of the X Window System that runs on UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (like Linux, the BSDs, Mac OS X (aka Darwin) and Solaris x86 series) operating systems and OS/2.\'94\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.5. \b0 What is an X Server?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 An X Server is a program that provides display and user input services to other programs. In comparison, a file server provides other programs with access to file storage devices. File servers are typically located in a remote location and you use the services of a file server from the machine that you are located at. In contrast, an X Server is typically running on the machine that you are located at; display and user input services may be requested by programs running on your machine, as well as by programs running on remote machines.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.6. \b0 What is an X client?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 An X client is a program that utilizes the display and user input services provided by an X Server. X clients may run on the same or disparate machine as the X Server that is providing display and user input services.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.7. \b0 Why port XFree86 to Microsoft Windows?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Porting XFree86 to Microsoft Windows benefits many people and projects in many ways:\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1640\sl260\fi-200 \tx1640 \fs16 \'95\tab \fs20 Prior to Cygwin/XFree86 only commercial, closed source X Servers were available for Microsoft Windows.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1640\sl260\fi-200 \tx1640 \fs16 \'95\tab \fs20 An X Server on Windows may be used to display the output of programs running on remote UNIX machines.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1640\sl260\fi-200 \tx1640 \fs16 \'95\tab \fs20 Cygwin/XFree86, in conjunction with Cygwin, provides a complete compatibility layer for compiling and running UNIX applications on Microsoft Windows.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 1.8. \b0 Is there a Cygwin/XFree86 newsgroup?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 No, Cygwin/XFree86 does not have a newsgroup; however, we do have a mailing list. See {\field{\*\fldinst   HYPERLINK  \\l ID_q_45_mailing_45_list}{\fldrslt Q: 1.9.}}\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_mailing_45_list}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_mailing_45_list}\b 1.9. \b0 Is there a Cygwin/XFree86 mailing list?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Yes, Cygwin/XFree86 has a mailing list, namely, cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com. Visit the Cygwin Mailing Lists (http://cygwin.com/lists.html) page to subscribe to cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com as well as to read and search an online archive of the mailing list traffic.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1840\sl234 \b\fs18\f1 Tip: \b0 Post your X-related inquires to cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com only; do not post nor cross post your inquires to the cygwin@cygwin.com mailing list. Cygwin's mailing list is only for Cygwin API related inquires that are not handled by another more-specific list.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li960\sl260 \b\fs20\f0 2. Installation\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 2.1. \b0 What versions of Windows does Cygwin/XFree86 run on?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Cygwin/XFree86 supports Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000 as of 2001-05-19. Windows XP will be supported when it is officially released.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \lang1033 Cygwin/XFree86 requires Cygwin to compile and run. Cygwin is not, as of 2001-07-10, available on Microsoft Windows CE, therefore Cygwin/XFree86 is not currently available on Microsoft Windows CE.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b\lang1024 2.2. \b0 How is Cygwin/XFree86 installed?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 The Cygwin/XFree86 User's Guide (http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/ug/) thoroughly documents the installation process.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 2.3. \b0 Which archives do I need to download and install?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 The Cygwin/XFree86 User's Guide (http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/ug/) lists the archives that need to be downloaded and installed.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_winzip}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_winzip}\b 2.4. \b0 Can I use WinZip to extract Cygwin/XFree86 archives?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 No. WinZip is not aware of Cygwin's symlink handling, nor does WinZip properly handle the end of line characters in Cygwin/XFree86's archives. Extracting Cygwin/XFree86's archives with a utility other than Cygwin's tar, gzip, and bzip2 will likely result in the X Server reporting that it cannot open a font file on startup; the server will shutdown immediately after giving this error.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_bunzip2}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_bunzip2}\b 2.5. \b0 bunzip2 reports: \'93It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.\'94\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Short answer: the bzip2 files on the server are not corrupt.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \lang1033 Downloading the Cygwin/XFree86 archives using a web browser causes all sorts of problems, as web browsers sometimes attempt to \'93help\'94 you by automatically decompressing downloaded files. However, the automatic decompression is broken in that the decompression process usually fails to remove the \fs18\f2 .bz2\fs20\f0  extension from the decompressed file. You may be able to simply rename the downloaded file, leaving off the \fs18\f2 .bz2\fs20\f0  extension; if that method fails, you will have to redownload the files, by using either a standard ftp client (e.g. \b ftp\b0  including with Cygwin), or by using your web browser and right-clicking the link to each file and choosing \f1 Save Target As...\f0 , \f1 Save Link As...\f0 , or a similarly named command. Choosing \f1 Save Target As...\f0 , \f1 Save Link As...\f0 , or a similarly named command instructs the web browser to save the file directly, without passing the file through any interpretation steps, thus preventing the web browser from automatically decompressing the files.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li960\sl260 \b\lang1024 3. Configuration\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 3.1. \b0 Why isn't there an XF86Config file?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Cygwin/XFree86 uses an entirely different server executable than XFree86. Cygwin/XFree86 queries Windows for configuration information and accesses your hardware in a device independent manner through the Win32 API, whereas the XFree86 server must read detailed information about your hardware from a configuration file.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 3.2. \b0 What are the command line arguments for XWin.exe?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 The Cygwin/XFree86 User's Guide (http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/ug/) documents the command line arguments for XWin.exe.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 3.3. \b0 Why does XWin.exe ignore the display depth that I pass on the command line?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 When running in windowed mode or GDI-based fullscreen mode, XWin.exe must run the X Server at whatever display depth Windows is currently using; in these cases the display depth passed on the command line is ignored. XWin.exe only uses the display depth parameter when running in a DirectDraw-based fullscreen mode, as DirectDraw allows applications to change the display resolution and depth when running in fullscreen mode.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 3.4. \b0 I have a two button mouse, can I emulate a three button mouse?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Yes. Pass the \i\f2 -emulate3buttons timeout_in_milliseconds\i0\f0  parameter to XWin.exe, where \i\f2 timeout_in_milliseconds\i0\f0  is the, optional, maximum number of milliseconds between a button release and opposite button press that will trigger an emulated third button press.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li960\sl260 \b 4. Usage\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 4.1. \b0 Why is twm the only window manager included with Cygwin/XFree86?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 twm resides in the XFree86 source tree, therefore it is compiled and released with Cygwin/XFree86 automatically. Other window managers are available, but they reside in other source trees and are therefore not released with the core Cygwin/XFree86 archives.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 4.2. \b0 What precompiled window managers are available?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 XFCE and vtwm are available \hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 4.3. \b0 How do I use a non-U.S. keyboard layout?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 See {\field{\*\fldinst   HYPERLINK  \\l ID_q_45_modmap_45_obtaining}{\fldrslt Q: 4.4.}} to obtain a modmap for your keyboard layout.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_modmap_45_obtaining}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_modmap_45_obtaining}\b 4.4. \b0 Where can I find an xmodmap for my non-U.S. keyboard layout?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 You can try using an xmodmap file for your keyboard layout from a GNU/Linux distribution (e.g. RedHat).\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 Or, you can use \b xkeycaps\b0  to automatically generate a modmap for one of over 208 different layouts. See the xkeycaps home page (http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/) to download and for more information.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 4.5. \b0 How do I get my non-U.S. keyboard modmap to be installed when using xdmcp?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 This answer assumes that your non-U.S. keyboard modmap is located in \fs18\f2 /etc/X11\fs20\f0  and is called \fs18\f2 xmodmap.\i country_code\i0\fs20\f0 , where \i\f2 country_code\i0\f0  is your two-letter standardized country code (e.g. Australia = au, Deutschland = de, France = fr, Japan = jp, United Kingdom = uk).\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \lang1033 First, you must create a script that tells \b xmodmap\b0  to load the modmap for your non-U.S. keyboard layout. One way to run \b xmodmap\b0  on X Server startup when using {\field{\*\fldinst   HYPERLINK  \\l ID_gloss_45_xdmcp}{\fldrslt \i xdmcp}} is to add the following two lines to \fs18\f2 /etc/X11/xdm/XSetup\fs20\f0 :\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \b\f2 #!/bin/sh\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 /usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap /etc/X11/xmodmap.\i country_code\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \b0\i0\f0 Now you must tell xdm to run the screen setup script on startup.

Unfortunately, there was a file named \fs18\f2 xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/xvmc.h\fs20\f0  that ended up getting included instead of the desired file, because the precompiler searched the local directory, \fs18\f2 xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/\fs20\f0 , before searching the rest of the include path. Cygwin can't distinquish between \fs18\f2 XvMC.h\fs20\f0  and \fs18\f2 xvmc.h\fs20\f0 , so \fs18\f2 xvmc.h\fs20\f0  ended up being included in \fs18\f2 xvmc.c\fs20\f0 .

Cygwin's developers went to great trouble to obtain this modification and should be thanked for doing so, as without it the modification, Cygwin/XFree86 linking to Cygwin would be the subject of endless discussion.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 \b 9.4. \b0 Whom holds the copyright on the Cygwin/XFree86 source code?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Cygwin/XFree86 proper doesn't have a single copyright holder, as Cygwin/XFree86 is made up of two parts, namely Cygwin and XFree86, that follow different schemes in regards to whom will hold the copyright on source code.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 \lang1033 See {\field{\*\fldinst   HYPERLINK  \\l ID_q_45_copyright_45_xfree}{\fldrslt Q: 9.5.}} and {\field{\*\fldinst   HYPERLINK  \\l ID_q_45_copyright_45_cygwin}{\fldrslt Q: 9.6.}} for more information regarding whom holds the copyright on Cygwin/XFree86 source code.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_copyright_45_xfree}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_copyright_45_xfree}\b\lang1024 9.5. \b0 Whom holds the copyright on the XFree86 source code?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 Each source code file in XFree86 typically has its own license and copyright statement. Therefore, there is not a general rule for determining whom holds the copyright on a particular XFree86 source file, as each author is free to assign the copyright to someone else, to some group, or to keep the copyright themselves.

As of 2001-07-10, Cygwin/XFree86 does not qualify as a platform that Open Motif can be distributed with and used on. However, the Open Motif FAQ (http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/faq.html) states, "[...] we hope to be able to make a distribution under a license complying with the Open Source guidelines sometime in the future.

But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_applicability_45_and_45_definitions}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_applicability_45_and_45_definitions}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 1.

The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_verbation_45_copying}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_verbation_45_copying}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 2.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_modifications}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_modifications}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 4.

If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_combining_45_documents}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_combining_45_documents}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb173\li960\sl260 \b0\fs20\lang1033\f0 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".

COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb173\li960\sl260 \b0\fs20\lang1033\f0 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_aggregation_45_with_45_independent_45_works}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_aggregation_45_with_45_independent_45_works}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb173\li960\sl260 \b0\fs20\lang1033\f0 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_translation}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_translation}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 8. TRANSLATION\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb173\li960\sl260 \b0\fs20\lang1033\f0 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_termination}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_termination}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 9.
