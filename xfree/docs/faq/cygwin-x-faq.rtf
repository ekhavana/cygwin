They function by using the Cygwin library which provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API.\'94 Cygwin provides the compiler (gcc), libraries, headers, and other utilities which build and support the operation of Cygwin/X.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_window_45_system}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_window_45_system}\b 1.3. \b0 What is the X Window System?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 [ScheiflerGettys92]\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li1440\sl260 The X Window System, or X, is a network-transparent window system. With X, multiple applications can run simultaneously in windows, generating text and graphics in monochrome or color on a bitmap display. Network transparency means that application programs can run on machines scattered through the network.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_server}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_server}\b 1.4. \b0 What is an X Server?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 An X Server is a program that provides display and user input services to other programs. In comparison, a file server provides other programs with access to file storage devices. File servers are typically located in a remote location and you use the services of a file server from the machine that you are located at. In contrast, an X Server is typically running on the machine that you are located at; display and user input services may be requested by programs running on your machine, as well as by programs running on remote machines.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb200\li1440\sl260 {\*\bkmkstart ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_client}{\*\bkmkend ID_q_45_what_45_is_45_x_45_client}\b 1.5. \b0 What is an X client?\keepn\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb50\li1440\sl260 An X client is a program that utilizes the display and user input services provided by an X Server.

Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_applicability_45_and_45_definitions}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_applicability_45_and_45_definitions}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 1.

The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_verbation_45_copying}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_verbation_45_copying}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 2.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb100\li960\sl260 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\hyphpar0\par\pard\sb259\s2\sl449 {\*\bkmkstart ID_gfdl_45_modifications}{\*\bkmkend ID_gfdl_45_modifications}\b\fs34\lang1024\f1 4.
