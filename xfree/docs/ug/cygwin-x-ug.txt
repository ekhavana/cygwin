Chapter 1. Cygwin/X Overview

   Cygwin/X is a port of the X Window System to Cygwin. The Cygwin
   library provides a UNIX-like API on the Win32 platform.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Setting Up Cygwin/X

Installing Cygwin/X

   Cygwin has a nice setup program that downloads and installs the
   necessary Cygwin packages for you.
    1. Open the Cygwin, http://cygwin.com/ page in your web browser
    2. Click on the "setup.exe" link. This link downloads setup.exe from
       the primary Cygwin server; save setup.exe to the directory that
       you would like to store the downloaded packages in (e.g.
       c:\download); do not save setup.exe to c:\cygwin, as that is the
       default directory for the extraction and installation of the
       downloaded packages.
    3. Run setup.exe, you will see the welcome screen:
       [cyi01welcome.png]
    4. Click Next to proceed to the next screen.
    5. Choose, Install from Internet, this will still save the package
       files to your download directory so that you can install Cygwin on
       any number of machines:
       [cyi02installoption.png]
    6. Click Next to proceed to the next screen.
    7. The default Install Root is c:\cygwin which should be fine for
       most installations. Leave Default Text File Type as UNIX. Leave
       Install For set to All unless you lack local administrative
       privileges.
       [cyi03installto.png]
    8. Click Next to proceed to the next screen.
    9. Local Package Directory should default to the directory that you
       ran setup.exe from:
       [cyi04directory.png]
   10. Click Next to proceed to the next screen.
   11. Choose your proxy setup, or, just choose Direct Connection if no
       proxy is needed:
       [cyi05proxy.png]
   12. Click Next to proceed to the next screen.
   13. Select your nearest mirror for downloading:
       [cyi06mirror.png]
   14. Click Next to proceed to the next screen; setup will download a
       list of available packages as it moves to the next screen.
   15. On the next screen you will select the packages that will be
       downloaded and installed. A listing of the Cygwin/X packages is
       given below; a listing of the general Cygwin packages would be
       beyond the scope of this document.
       Cygwin/X packages are located in the X11 category.
          + xorg-server (required, the Cygwin/X X Server)
          + xinit (required, scripts for starting the X server: xinit,
            startx, startwin (and a shortcut on the Start Menu to run
            it), startxdmcp.bat )
          + xorg-docs (optional, man pages)
          + X-start-menu-icons (optional, adds icons for X Clients to the
            Start menu)
          + You may also select any X client programs you want to use,
            and any fonts you would like to have available.
          + You may also want to ensure that the openssh package is
            selected if you wish to use ssh connections to run remote X
            clients.
          + You may also want to ensure that the inetutils or rsh
            packages are selected if you wish to use telnet or rsh
            connections to run remote X clients. (not recommended)
       [cyi07packages.png]
   16. Click Next to begin the download process, you may want to try
       another mirror if you see a "Connecting" message on this screen
       for a long period of time:
       [cyi08downloading.png]
   17. After the packages are downloaded, setup will automatically begin
       to install them:
       [cyi09installing.png]
   18. I highly recommend allowing Cygwin Setup to create Desktop and
       Start Menu icons for you; these icons simply launch a bash shell:
       [cyi10createicons.png]
   19. Click Finish to close the setup program.

   You have now successfully installed Cygwin/X.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Configuring Cygwin/X

Configuration overview

   Cygwin/X settings are configured primarily through command-line
   parameters passed to XWin.exe.

   A XWinrc file is used to configure the notification area icon menu,
   and customize window appearance in multiwindow mode.
     _________________________________________________________________

Windowing mode

   Cygwin/X can be configured to present X windows for an X screen in
   three different ways:
     * Windowed or rooted mode. (default)
       Each X screen appears as a single Windows window and all X windows
       are contained within those windows. (the Windows window contains
       the X root window for the screen)

     Note: This is typically used to present a virtual full-screen X
     session using the X window manager of your choice, or for remote
     XDMCP sessions.
       The -nodecoration option can be used to remove the Windows window
       decorations from the X screen window. Alternatively, the
       -fullscreen option can be used to show the X screen in exclusive
       fullscreen mode.
     * Multiwindow mode. (-multiwindow)
       Each top-level X window appears in its own Windows window.

     Note: This is typically used to work with local or remote X
     applications, integrated into your native Windows desktop.
     * Rootless mode. (-rootless)
       The X root window is hidden from view, but top-level X windows are
       drawn.

     Note: This is typically used to work with local or remote X
     applications, integrated into your native Windows desktop, but
     controlled using the X window manager of your choice.
     Because the X root window is hidden in this mode, this is not
     particulaly useful with X window managers with which you need to
     interact with the root window (for example, clicking on the root
     window to get a menu listing programs you can launch) [1] , but is
     more useful with X window managers which work with a dock or panel
     window for selecting applications from.
     Also note that the X window manager has no knowledge of the
     stacking of Windows windows, and vice versa, so raising one X
     window above a Windows window raises all of the X windows, and
     raising one Windows window above an X window raises it above all of
     the X windows. Exactly as if all X windows were being drawn into a
     hidden Windows window :-)
     _________________________________________________________________

Command line parameters

   Cygwin/X, by default, runs in windowed mode with the largest window
   that will fit on your Windows desktop, using the best performing
   engine that is installed on your system, with clipboard integration
   enabled. You do not need to pass any parameters to XWin.exe to use the
   default behavior.

   Up to date documentation of XWin.exe options can be read with man XWin
   .
     _________________________________________________________________

XWinrc configuration file

   With the .XWinrc configuration file it is possible to:
     * Add items and submenus into the menu opened by right-clicking on
       the notification area icon.
     * In multiwindow mode: add items and submenus into the Windows
       window system menu (opened by clicking on the icon in the top-left
       of the Windows window frame) and override the window icon and
       window styles for Windows windows, by window name or window class
       name.

   Full documentation of the XWinrc file format and command can be read
   with man XWinrc .
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Using Cygwin/X

Starting Cygwin/X

   Described below are several methods of starting up the Cygwin/X X
   Server with a startup utility that optionally starts initial clients
   (for example, a terminal or a window manager) and performs X server
   configuration (for example, loading a keyboard modifier map).
     _________________________________________________________________

Starting Cygwin/X in multiwindow mode (startxwin)

   Use the custom XWin startup utility startxwin

   startxwin is included in the xinit package (installed by following the
   instructions in the Section called Installing Cygwin/X in Chapter 2),
   which starts the X server in multiwindow mode along with a single X
   terminal. Run startxwin by:
     * using the "XWin Server" shortcut under "Cygwin-X" on the Start
       Menu
     * Starting /usr/bin/startxwin in a Cygwin shell:

$ startxwin

   Full documentation for startxwin can be read with man startxwin . Note
   that the special option -- is used to mark the end of client options
   and the beginning of server options, so, for example, if you wish to
   start the X server with the -noclipboard option, as described in the
   Section called Command line parameters in Chapter 3, use the following
   command:
   $ startxwin -- -noclipboard

   You may create a ~/.startxwinrc script to customize the client
   programs started, rather than a single xterm.

     Note: The MS-DOS batch file startxwin.bat and bash shell script
     startxwin.sh previously used to start the X server are no longer
     provided. Implemented as a script made it difficult to reliably
     wait until the the X server had started before starting any
     clients. Use startxwin instead.

     Note: It's not recommended to start startxwin from a MS-DOS shell
     or by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer. To do so means that
     XWin is not started from a login shell, and programs started from
     the notification area icon menu will not inherit the environment of
     a login shell. This may lead to unexpected behaviour, for example,
     if you have customizations to your login shell start-up scripts
     which set environment variables.

     Note: If you want to have a Start Menu shortcut which runs
     startxwin with custom options, you should use a copy of the Start
     Menu shortcut installed by xinit, so that your changes are not
     overwritten when the xinit package is updated.

     Note: startxwin is a specialized version of startx with a few
     differences appropriate to running in multiwindow mode, rather than
     windowed mode.
     * startxwin supplies the -multiwindow option to XWin.exe
     * It uses a different script to start clients (~/.startxwinrc rather
       than ~/.xinitrc), because ~/.xinitrc will normally end by starting
       a window manager, which would be incorrect for ~/.startxwinrc (as
       it would discover the internal window manager is already running
       and exit immediately).
     * startxwin exits after ~/.startxwinrc has completed and leaves
       XWin.exe running, whereas startx waits until ~/.xinitrc exits
       (which is usually waiting for the window manager started by it to
       exit) and then kills XWin.exe.
     _________________________________________________________________

Starting Cygwin/X in windowed mode (startx)

   Use the standard X Window System startx command with its attendant
   ~/.xinitrc configuration file.

   Run startx in a Cygwin shell:
   $ startx

   Full documentation for startx can be read with man startx . Note that
   the special option -- is used to mark the end of client options and
   the beginning of server options, so, for example, if you wish to start
   the X server with the -emulate3buttons option, as described in the
   Section called Command line parameters in Chapter 3, use the following
   command:
   $ startx -- -emulate3buttons

   You may create a ~/.xinitrc from the template in
   /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and then customize ~/.xinitrc as required
$ cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
[edit ~/.xinitrc as desired]

   Alternatively, if you just want to start a single client program
   (perhaps a window manager), you don't need to use a ~/.xinitrc, and
   can start the client directly from startx, e.g.
   $ startx /usr/bin/fvwm2

     Note: The client name supplied to startx must begin with / or .,
     otherwise it is treated as options to the default xterm client.
     _________________________________________________________________

Other startup methods

   Advanced users may wish to start the X server by invoking XWin
   directly, for example, to start XDMCP sessions.
     _________________________________________________________________

Switching out of Cygwin/X

   When running in windowed mode, press Alt-Tab to switch from Cygwin/X
   to your Windows desktop or other running Windows applications.
     _________________________________________________________________

Stopping Cygwin/X

   When you are done using Cygwin/X, you can shutdown the X server by:
     * Selecting the "Exit..." option from the notification area icon
       menu
     * In Windowed mode: Press Alt-F4 to shutdown the X Server. This can
       be disabled using the -nowinkill option.
     * In Windowed mode: Close the X server window in the conventional
       ways, e.g. by clicking on the "X" button at the upper-right corner
       of the X screen window frame, or choosing "Close" from the control
       menu opened by left-clicking on the X logo icon at the upper-left
       corner of the X screen window frame.
     * Using the -unixkill option allows the Ctrl-Alt-Backspace key
       combination to shutdown the X Server.

   If clients are still connected to the X server, you will be prompted
   to confirm you wish to shutdown the X server.
     _________________________________________________________________

Window managers

   A window manager is required in order to decorate, move, resize, and
   perform other operations on individual X windows.

   Cygwin/X can work with window managers in several different ways:
     * Internal window manager for multiwindow mode. The internal window
       manager that creates a Windows window for each top-level X window
       is automatically started when using the -multiwindow command-line
       parameter to XWin.exe. See the Section called Command line
       parameters in Chapter 3 for more information on the -multiwindow
       command-line parameter.
     * External local window managers (e.g. twm, mwm (part of the lesstif
       package), fvwm2, openbox, aewm++, WindowMaker). These local window
       managers must be installed on Cygwin and run locally.
     * Remote window managers started by logging into an XDMCP session.
       You can read more about XDMCP in the Section called Remote
       sessions via XDMCP.
     * Remote window manager launched through an ssh tunnel. This is not
       Cygwin/X-specific, so you should be able to find information about
       launching remote window managers from other sources. See the
       Section called Secure ssh for more information on using ssh.
     _________________________________________________________________

Windows Clipboard integration

   The X Window System, and thus Cygwin/X, uses its own internal
   clipboard system that is distinct from the clipboard system used by
   Windows. Copying and pasting text between these two clipboard systems
   requires a clipboard integration program that watches for updates to
   either clipboard and copies data between them when either one is
   updated.

   Cygwin/X has an internal clipboard integration system that is enabled
   by default. See the Section called Command line parameters in Chapter
   3 for more information on the -[no]clipboard command-line parameters.
     _________________________________________________________________

Shared memory support

   Shared memory is needed by the MIT-SHM and XFree86-BigFont extensions,
   which may provide better performance for local applications which use
   large images or fonts and are written to use those extensions.

   In Cygwin, XSI shared memory is provided by the cygserver Windows
   service. To install cygserver, install it using setup.exe and then run
   the cygserver-config script to install the service.

     Note: This note is applicable to Cygwin 1.5 only. Cygwin 1.7
     automatically enables shared memory if the cygserver Windows
     service is running. 

     Shared memory will only be used if the CYGWIN environment variable
     contains the server keyword.

     For example, starting XWin.exe with

     CYGWIN=server XWin.exe

     or setting the CYGWIN environment variable in the Windows control
     panel to contain server will enable shared memory support if the
     cygserver service is running.
     _________________________________________________________________

Remote sessions via XDMCP

   Cygwin/X can be used login to one or several remote sessions using
   XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol).

   Start Cygwin/X with a command similar to the following to login to a
   single remote session using XDMCP:

   XWin.exe -query remote_hostname_or_ip_address

   You may login to several remote sesstions with a single or multiple
   hosts using XDMCP. Each session will need a seperate display number,
   specified by the :display_number parameter, such as :0. A display
   number is not the same as a screen number, as a single display can
   have multiple screens associated with it. Each display listens on a
   different network port number, so each display can connect to multiple
   machines. Start Cygwin/X with command lines similar to the following
   to login to several remote sessions using XDMCP:

   XWin.exe :0 -query remote_hostname_or_ip_address_0

   XWin.exe :1 -query remote_hostname_or_ip_address_1

   Note that the :display_number parameter is a general X Server
   parameter, not specific to Cygwin/X. Further documentation of the
   :display_number parameter can be found in the X Server manual page.
   XDMCP is a complex system that is not specific to Cygwin/X; further
   discussion of XDMCP is beyond the scope of this document. You may wish
   to read the Linux XDMCP HOWTO or the X Server XDMCP Options for more
   information.

     Note: For security reasons, XDMCP is not enabled by default on most
     modern UNIX distributions. You will have to enable remote logins to
     your X Display Manager (xdm, kdm, gdm, etc.). See the configuration
     documentation for your X Display Manager and/or UNIX distribution.
     The Cygwin/X FAQ section on XDMCP may also be helpful.
     _________________________________________________________________

Displaying remote clients

   Displaying remote X clients with Cygwin/X is nearly identical to
   displaying remote X clients with any other X Server. You may use the
   secure ssh method, or the insecure telnet or rsh method (not
   recommended).
     _________________________________________________________________

Secure ssh

   On your Windows machine:
    1. Make sure you have the openssh package installed.
    2. Launch Cygwin/X
    3. Ensure the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. (This
       step is not neccessary if you are entering your commands into an X
       terminal, as DISPLAY must already be set in that case)

$ export DISPLAY=:0.0

    4. Run the ssh command to connect to the remote host:

$ ssh -Y username@remote_hostname_or_ip_address

    5. Enter your password when prompted by ssh.
    6. Your ssh session should now show you a shell prompt for your
       remote machine.

     Note: The ssh server will automatically set the DISPLAY environment
     variable appropriately, typically to something like localhost:10.0,
     so clients will connect to a proxy X11 display on the remote host
     from which the X11 protocol will be forwarded over ssh to your X
     server.
     If your login scripts unconditionally set DISPLAY to something
     else, this will break X11 forwarding.
    7. You can now launch remote X clients in your ssh session, for
       example, xterm& will launch an xterm running on your remote host
       that will display on your Cygwin/X screen.
    8. Launch other remote clients in the same manner. I recommend
       starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to
       the command name, so that you don't have to open several ssh
       sessions.

     Note: By default, the OpenSSH server does not allow forwarded X
     connections. This must be configured on the remote host by adding
     X11Forwarding yes to the sshd_config configuration file. The
     OpenSSH server must be restarted or SIGHUP'ed to re-read the
     configuration file after it is changed.

     Note: The OpenSSH server requires the xauth command to be available
     to forward X connections. Consequently, it must be installed on the
     remote host.
     _________________________________________________________________

Insecure telnet or rsh (Not recommended)

   On your Windows machine:
    1. Make sure you have the inetutils package installed (for telnet) or
       rsh package (for rsh).
    2. Launch Cygwin/X
    3. In an X terminal, use the xhost command to allow the remote host
       access to make connections to your X server:

$ xhost remote_hostname_or_ip_address

    4. Run the telnet or rsh command to connect to the remote host:

$ /usr/bin/telnet remote_hostname_or_ip_address

       or

$ rsh remote_hostname_or_ip_address

     Note: Use the explicit path to ensure that Cygwin's telnet is run
     instead of Microsoft's telnet. Microsoft's telnet cannot read input
     or display output correctly when run from a Cygwin shell.
    5. Login to your remote machine
    6. Ensure the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly in your
       remote session.

$ export DISPLAY=windows_hostname_or_ip_address:0.0

    7. You can now launch remote X clients, for example, xterm& will
       launch an xterm running on your remote host that will display on
       your Cygwin/X screen.
    8. Launch other remote clients in the same manner; I recommend
       starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to
       the command name, so that you don't have to open several telnet
       sessions.

     Note: This is insecure because (1) when you log in, your username
     and password may be transmitted in clear across the network between
     you and the remote host (2) the X protocol is transmitted in clear
     across the network between you and the remote host, and (3) you
     have allowed any user on the remote host to connect to your X
     server and monitor your X session. For these reasons, use ssh
     forwarding rather than telnet, if at all possible.
     _________________________________________________________________

Hardware Accelerated OpenGL (AIGLX)

     Note: This is feature is still under active development and should
     be considered beta quality, but should be working well enough to be
     useful. Please report success or failure with specific OpenGL
     applications to the cygwin-xfree mailing list.

   Cygwin/X supports hardware accelerated OpenGL rendering in the X
   server using the native Windows OpenGL (WGL) interface. Use the
   command line option -wgl to the X server to turn on the use of the
   native Windows OpenGL implementation. This option is only supported by
   multiwindow mode currently. If you don't use this option, the X server
   will use software rendering.

   For remote clients, Mesa's libGL prefers to use client-side rendering
   and transfer the image to the server using xlib. To force indirect
   rendering (which takes place on the server), you must do export
   LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 before starting the client application.
   There's a performance trade-off between rendering performance and
   network latency, so you should try both direct and indirect rendering
   and see which performs best in your specific circumstances. Generally,
   accelerated indirect rendering should be more performant for clients
   which render complex scenes.

   For local clients, indirect rendering is the default, so no special
   steps are needed.

   If you have set things up successfully, glxinfo | grep OpenGL should
   output something mentioning your graphics card vendor. If it mentions
   Mesa, you still have software rendering

   Please ensure you are using the latest display drivers for your
   graphics hardware before reporting any visual issues with WGL.

   Known issues:
     * OpenGL windows with static contents aren't re-drawn when occluded
       by a native Window and then exposed. Workaround: force the window
       to redraw, e.g. by resizing it.
     * When an OpenGL window is behind a native application window which
       uses layered windows for translucency, the OpenGL rendering is
       drawn over the top, flickering.

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
     Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
     and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
     changing it is not allowed.
     _________________________________________________________________

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
