Chapter 1. Cygwin/XFree86 Overview

   Cygwin/XFree86 is a port of XFree86 to Cygwin; Cygwin provides a
   UNIX-like API on the Win32 platform. As of 2001-07-01 the supported
   Win32 platforms are Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT
   4.0, and Windows 2000.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Setting Up Cygwin/XFree86

Cygwin/XFree86 Contents

   Cygwin/XFree86 consists of two parts: Cygwin, a port of the GNU tools
   to Win32, and Cygwin/XFree86, a port of XFree86 to Win32. Both parts
   of Cygwin/XFree86 are needed to successfully run an X Server on a
   Win32 platform.
     _________________________________________________________________

Downloading Cygwin

   Cygwin tools are, in the words of the Cygwin development homepage,
   [35]http://cygwin.com/, "ports of the popular GNU development tools
   and utilities for Windows 95, 98, and NT. They function by using the
   Cygwin library which provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32
   API." Cygwin allows the compilation of the XFree86 source on Win32;
   several patches were made to the XFree86 source to make XFree86
   actually compile and run under Cygwin; those patches have been merged
   into the XFree86 4.0 source tree.

   Cygwin has a nice setup program that downloads and installs the
   necessary Cygwin packages for you.

     Tip: Be sure to use setup.exe version 2.13 or greater if you intend
     to save the downloaded packages to a Samba share; some versions of
     Samba have a problem with prior versions of setup.exe.

    1. Open the Cygwin, [36]http://cygwin.com/ page in your web browser
    2. Click the "Install Cygwin Now" link in the upper-right hand corner
       of the page; or, click the "Install" link next to "Latest net
       release:", which should be near the top of the page in the main
       content area. This link downloads setup.exe from the primary
       Cygwin server; save setup.exe to the directory that you would like
       to store the downloaded packages in (e.g. c:\cyginstall); do not
       save setup.exe to c:\cygwin, as that is the default directory for
       the extraction and installation of the downloaded packages. At the
       time of writing, a full download of all Cygwin packages takes 25
       MB of disk space.
    3. Run setup.exe, you will see the welcome screen:
       Cygwin Download - Installation welcome screen
    4. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    5. Choose, Download from Internet, this will save the package files
       to your download directory so that you can install Cygwin on any
       number of machines:
       Cygwin Download - Download or install packages
    6. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    7. Local Package Directory should default to the directory that you
       ran setup.exe from:
       Cygwin Download - Local package directory
    8. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    9. Choose your proxy setup, or, just choose Direct Connection to
       limit the scope of download problems:
       Cygwin Download - Proxy settings
   10. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
   11. Select your nearest mirror for downloading:
       Cygwin Download - Choose mirror
   12. Click Next to proceed to the next screen; setup will download a
       list of available packages as it moves to the next screen
   13. All packages, downloaded size of 56.1 MB as of 2001-04-19, are
       selected for download by default; I do not recommend changing the
       list of packages to download unless you really know what you are
       doing:
       Cygwin Download - Choose packages to download
   14. Click Next to begin the download process, you may want to try
       another mirror if you see a "Connecting" message on this screen
       for a long period of time:
       Cygwin Download - Downloading packages
   15. You should receive a message that the download has completed; you
       now have all of the packages necessary for installation of Cygwin:
       Cygwin Download - Installation complete
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing Cygwin

   You may install the downloaded Cygwin packages on any number of the
   machines by simply copying your download directory to that machine, or
   making the download directory accessible via a network share, and
   following the installation steps below. The following installation
   steps assume that you are installing Cygwin on the same machine that
   you used to download the Cygwin packages.

   Follow these steps to install Cygwin:
    1. Run setup.exe from your download directory (e.g. c:\cyginstall),
       you will get the same welcome screen as before:
       Cygwin Install - Installation welcome screen
    2. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    3. Choose Install from Local Directory:
       Cygwin Install - Download or install packages
    4. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    5. Local Package Directory should default to the directory that you
       ran setup.exe from, which should also be the same directory that
       you previously downloaded the packages to:
       Cygwin Install - Local package directory
    6. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    7. The default Install Root is c:\cygwin; this should be fine for
       most installations. Leave Default Text File Type as UNIX. If you
       have several users on your NT machine, and you are logged in with
       local administrative privileges, you may wish to set Install For
       to All, but the default of Just Me will work fine for single user
       machines.
       Cygwin Install - Install root, default text mode, and multi user
       or single user
    8. Click Next to proceed to the next screen
    9. All downloaded packages, with an installed size of 175 MB as of
       2001-04-19, are selected for installation by default; I do not
       recommend changing the list of packages to install unless you
       really know what you are doing:
       Cygwin Install - Select packages to install
   10. Click Next to proceed with the installation
       Cygwin Install - Installing
   11. I highly recommend allowing Cygwin Setup to create Desktop and
       Start Menu icons for you; these icons simply launch a bash shell:
       Cygwin Install - Create icons
   12. Click Next to finish Cygwin Setup:
       Cygwin Install - Installation complete
     _________________________________________________________________

Downloading Cygwin/XFree86

   Cygwin/XFree86 is comprised of several binary tarballs.

   Follow these steps to download Cygwin/XFree86 binaries:
    1. Visit the [37]Cygwin mirrors page to find your closest mirror
    2. The ftp url for your mirror site should take you to the cygwin/
       directory on the mirror
    3. Download the following files from xfree/xc-4-binaries/4.1.0,
       saving them to the tmp directory in the root of your Cygwin
       installation directory (e.g. c:\cygwin). The full path that you
       save the files to will look like c:\cygwin\tmp. The compressed
       file size appears after each file; as of 2001-07-01 you will need
       approximately 30 MB of disk space to download the required files,
       your download size will vary if you choose to download any
       optional files.

     Downloading with a Web Browser: Some web browsers automatically
     decompress saved files when you use the left mouse button to follow
     the link to a file; bunzip2 will report, "Data integrity error when
     decompressing.", when attempting to decompress a file that has been
     decompressed by your web browser. Prevent your files from being
     automatically decompressed by clicking the right mouse button on a
     file link and choosing a command such as Save Target As... or Save
     Link As... from the context sensitive menu. Better yet, download
     your files with a stand alone ftp client.

     _________________________________________________________________

Installing Cygwin/XFree86

   Cygwin/XFree86 binaries are installed by the Xinstall.sh script.

   Follow these steps to install Cygwin/XFree86 binaries:
    1. Launch your Cygwin environment, using either the icon on your
       Desktop, the icon in your Start Menu, or by running cygwin.bat
       from your Cygwin directory (e.g. c:\cygwin); you should see a
       window like the following:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    2. Change the current directory to the tmp directory in your Cygwin
       root directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd /tmp

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$

    3. Extract the extract.exe.bz2 archive:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$ bunzip2 extract.exe.bz2

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$

    4. Copy the extract.exe file to /bin:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$ cp extract.exe /bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$

    5. Run the Xinstall.sh script. Follow the step-by-step instructions
       that the script provides:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$ ./Xinstall.sh

                Welcome to the XFree86 4.1.0 installer

You are strongly advised to backup your existing XFree86 installation
before proceeding.  This includes the /usr/X11R6 and /etc/X11
directories.  The installation process will overwrite existing files
in those directories, and this may include some configuration files
that may have been customised.

If you are installing a version different from 4.1.0, you
may need an updated version of this installer script.

Do you wish to continue? (y/n) [n] y

...

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$

    6. Copy startup-scripts.tgz to /usr/X11R6/bin:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$ cp startup-scripts.tgz /usr/X11R6/bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$

    7. Change the current directory to /usr/X11R6/bin:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /tmp
$ cd /usr/X11R6/bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr/X11R6/bin
$

    8. Extract startup-scripts.tgz:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr/X11R6/bin
$ tar -xzf startup-scripts.tgz

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr/X11R6/bin
$

    9. Installation of Cygwin/XFree86 binaries is now complete.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Configuring Cygwin/XFree86

Configuration Overview

   Cygwin/XFree86 settings are configured primarily through command-line
   parameters passed to XWin.exe. Cygwin/XFree86 comes with a file called
   startxwin.bat that launches an X Server, a terminal, and a window
   manager.
     _________________________________________________________________

Command Line Parameters

   Cygwin/XFree86, by default, runs in windowed mode with the largest
   window that will fit on your Windows desktop, using the best
   performing engine that is installed on your system; you do not need to
   pass any parameters to XWin.exe to use the default behavior. Below is
   the syntax for XWin.exe parameters.

   XWin.exe
   [-screen screen_number width height ...]
   [-engine engine_number ]
   [-fullscreen [-depth depth_in_bits_per_pixel ] [-refresh
   refresh_rate_in_herz ] ]
   [-emulate3buttons timeout_in_milliseconds ]
   [-[no]winkill]
   [-[no]unixkill]

   Below is an example command line for XWin.exe.

   XWin.exe -screen 0 800 600 -fullscreen -depth 32 -refresh 85
   -emulate3buttons 100 -nowinkill -unixkill
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Using Cygwin/XFree86

Starting Cygwin/XFree86

   There are several methods of starting the Cygwin/XFree86 X Server with
   a startup script that optionally starts initial clients and loads
   keyboard modifier maps. Several startup methods are described below.
     _________________________________________________________________

startxwin.bat

   startxwin.bat - Use a MS-DOS batch file as the startup script. An
   example startxwin.bat is included in startup-scripts.tgz, which is
   extracted according to the instructions in [38]the Section called
   Installing Cygwin/XFree86 in Chapter 2. Run
   /usr/X11R6/bin/startxwin.bat by double-clicking it in Windows
   Explorer.
     _________________________________________________________________

startxwin.sh

   startxwin.sh - Use an sh shell script as the startup script. An
   example startxwin.sh is included in startup-scripts.tgz, which is
   extracted according to the instructions in [39]the Section called
   Installing Cygwin/XFree86 in Chapter 2. Run
   /usr/X11R6/bin/startxwin.sh in a Cygwin shell:
Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ sh /usr/X11R6/bin/startxwin.sh
     _________________________________________________________________

startx

   startx - Use the standard XFree86 startx script with its attendant
   ~/.xinitrc configuration file. First you need to create ~/.xinitrc
   from the template in /etc/X11/xinit/:
Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc

   Now you may customize ~/.xinitrc and start Cygwin/XFree86 with:
Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd /usr/X11R6/bin && startx

   Or, you can run startx by first adding /usr/X11R6/bin/ to the search
   path:
Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ PATH=%PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ startx

   Or, you can run startx by first changing directories to
   /usr/X11R6/bin/:
Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd /usr/X11R6/bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr/X11R6/bin
$ startx
     _________________________________________________________________

Switching Out of Cygwin/XFree86

   Press Alt-Tab to switch from Cygwin/XFree86 to your Windows desktop or
   other running Windows applications.
     _________________________________________________________________

Stopping Cygwin/XFree86

   When you are done running Cygwin/XFree86, press Alt-F4 to shutdown the
   X server.
     _________________________________________________________________

Remote Sessions via XDMCP

   Cygwin/XFree86 can be used login to a remote session using XDMCP (X
   Display Manager Control Protocol).

   Start Cygwin/XFree86 with a command similar to the following to login
   to a remote session using XDMCP:

   XWin.exe -screen screen_number widthxheightxdepth -query
   remote_host_ip_address -from local_host_ip_address

   XDMCP is a complex system; further discussion of XDMCP is beyond the
   scope of this document.
     _________________________________________________________________

Displaying Remote Clients

   Displaying remote X clients with Cygwin/XFree86 is nearly identical to
   displaying remote X clients with any other X Server. You may use the
   unsecure telnet session, or the secure ssh method.
     _________________________________________________________________

Unsecure Telnet

   On your Windows machine:
    1. Launch Cygwin/XFree86
    2. In an X terminal type /usr/X11R6/bin/xhost remote_host_ip_address
    3. In an X terminal type /usr/bin/telnet remote_host_ip_address. Use
       the explicit path to ensure that Cygwin's telnet is run instead of
       Microsoft's telnet; Microsoft's telnet will crash on startup when
       run from Cygwin/XFree86.
    4. Login to your remote machine via your telnet session
    5. In your telnet session type, DISPLAY=windows_host_ip_address:0.0
    6. In your telnet session type, export DISPLAY
    7. You can now launch remote X clients in your telnet session, for
       example, xterm& will launch an xterm running on your remote host
       that will display on your Cygwin/XFree86 screen.
    8. Launch other remote clients in the same manner; I recommend
       starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to
       the command name, so that you don't have to open several telnet
       sessions.
     _________________________________________________________________

Secure ssh

   On your Windows machine:
    1. Launch Cygwin/XFree86
    2. Run the following in an X terminal:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ ssh -X -l username remote_host_or_ip_address

    3. Enter your password when prompted by ssh.
    4. Your ssh session should now show you a shell prompt for your
       remote machine.
    5. You can now launch remote X clients in your ssh session, for
       example, xterm& will launch an xterm running on your remote host
       that will display on your Cygwin/XFree86 screen.
    6. Launch other remote clients in the same manner. I recommend
       starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to
       the command name, so that you don't have to open several ssh
       sessions.

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [40]http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
