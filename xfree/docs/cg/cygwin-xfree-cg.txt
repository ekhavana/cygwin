Chapter 1. Overview

   The Cygwin/XFree86 project can use your help! We will do everything we
   can to make experienced contributers productive as soon as possible.
   We also want to make it as easy as possible for new contributers to
   make Cygwin/XFree86 their first open source project.

   Cygwin/XFree86 is part of the vast number of open source/free software
   programs that provide compatibility with closed source/commercial
   software products. Cygwin/XFree86 enables the coexistence of closed
   software and open software during the period of transition from an
   almost completely closed software market to an almost completely open
   software market.

   Join in the excitement of opening your Windows machine to the X Window
   System.

   We need [31]programmers, [32]documentation writers, and [33]website
   maintainers.

Chapter 2. Programming

Overview

   This chapter provides a consolidated overview of all of the
   information needed to begin making source code contributions to
   Cygwin/XFree86. Creating a source code contribution for Cygwin/XFree86
   requires an amazingly small amount of information; however, prior to
   this document that tiny amount of information was difficult to obtain,
   as it was scattered across several documents and source code files.
   New programmers with no open source project experience, as well as
   programming gurus, will be able to make sourc code contributions to
   Cygwin/XFree86 after reading this chapter. Programming gurus are
   great; our intention is to create more of them.

   You will want to start downloading the XFree86 source code tree
   immediately after reading [34]the section called Obtaining the Source
   Code, if you have an active network connection at your disposal, as
   downloading the source code tree can take anywhere from 10 minutes to
   10 hours, depending upon the speed of your connection. You will find
   it advantageous to have a source code tree as you read the later
   sections.
     _________________________________________________________________

Native Compiling

Obtaining the Source Code

   Cygwin/XFree86 source code is contained in, and distributed with, the
   XFree86 source code tree. Read-only [35]CVS access to the XFree86
   source tree is also available from the XFree86 project.

   The XFree86 CVS tree is not always buildable on Cygwin, as the XFree86
   CVS tree is modified frequently, and sometimes those modifications
   cause building on Cygwin to fail; however, there are a few developers
   monitoring the build state of the XFree86 CVS tree on Cygwin, and they
   quickly fix build problems as they appear. It is unlikely that you
   will experience problems building XFree86 on Cygwin; in the event that
   you do experience build problems, you may wish to drop a note to
   cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com to let the developers there know that the tree
   is not building correctly.

   Periodically the Cygwin/XFree86 project releases a snapshot of the
   XFree86 source code that is known to compile. It is perfectly
   acceptable, though rarely necessary, to do your independent
   development work from a stable source code snapshot, rather than from
   the XFree86 CVS tree. Developing from a stable source code snapshots
   minimizes the scope of problems that you may encounter, which can
   greatly ease debugging of new features and other code modifications.

   It is highly recommended to get the XFree86 [36]CVS tree by using the
   CVS [37]pserver method. CVS pserver is the easiest CVS method to use
   for anonymous access to public CVS trees, as you need only type in a
   well-known password to download the CVS tree. CVS pserver is rarely
   used to control checkins to CVS trees, as the passwords are stored and
   sent as plain text; thus, pserver is extremely insecure. However,
   security does not matter for a public read-only CVS tree.

   Follow these steps to checkout the XFree86 CVS tree:
    1. Open a Cygwin bash shell by double clicking the Cygwin icon on
       your desktop, or by selecting Start, then Programs, followed by
       Cygnus Solutions, and finally Cygwin Bash Shell. You will see
       output similar to the following:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    2. Create a directory in which to store your XFree86 CVS tree and
       your builds; ~/x-devel is recommended:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ mkdir x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    3. Change the current directory to your new XFree86 development
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    4. Set the CVSROOT environment variable to point to the XFree86 CVS
       repository:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.xfree86.org:/cvs

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ export CVSROOT

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    5. Login to the CVS server, using password "anoncvs":

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cvs login
(Logging in to anoncvs@anoncvs.xfree86.org)
CVS password:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    6. Checkout the xc/ directory from the XFree86 CVS tree:

     Tip: The -zn parameter specifies the compression level to use, from
     1 to 9, with 9 being maximum compression.

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, a checked out XFree86 CVS source code tree
     contains 16,199 files in 3,021 folders, which is 242 MB of data,
     but requires 285 MB of storage space on a file system using 4 KB
     allocation units.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cvs -z4 checkout xc
cvs server: Updating xc

...

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

       You may preserve a logfile for the checkout session by instead
       using the following command:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cvs -z4 checkout xc > xc-cvs-checkout.log 2>&1

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling the Source Code

   Compiling Cygwin/XFree86 doesn't have to be hard, although the XFree86
   source code tree contains over 250 MB of data. There are a few simple
   techniques that make building the source code, keeping the source code
   up to date, and keeping the source code organized much easier.
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling Overview

   Compiling the XFree86 source code tree is a lot easier when you keep
   your builds in directories seperate from the source code directory.
   Keeping the source code and builds in seperate directories allows you
   to have many builds for different configurations, allows you to easily
   delete a build, and keeps the source code tree clean and manageable.

   A small utility, lndir.exe, is needed to keep your builds directories
   sepereate from your source directory; lndir.exe works just like the
   standard ln on UNIX, but lndir.exe creates links recursively for all
   files and directories in the specified directory. The lndir.exe
   utility is included with the XFree86 source code tree; but the catch
   is that you need to build the tree before you get lndir.exe. lndir.exe
   has been compiled and is available at
   [38]http://www.msu.edu/~huntharo/xwin/lndir.exe.bz2 (8 kB). Download
   the file, saving it to your Cygwin root directory (e.g. c:\cygwin),
   then follow the simple instructions below to install the utility:
    1. Launch a Cygwin bash prompt. You should see a screen similar to
       the following:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    2. Change to your Cygwin root directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd /

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    3. Uncompress lndir.exe.bz2:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$ bunzip2 lndir.exe.bz2

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    4. Copy lndir.exe to /bin:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$ cp lndir.exe /bin

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    5. Verify that lndir is working:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$ lndir
usage: lndir.exe [-silent] [-ignorelinks] fromdir [todir]

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    6. The lndir utility is now installed.
     _________________________________________________________________

Standard Build

   Follow these steps to create a standard, non-debug, build:
    1. Change the current directory to your XFree86 development
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    2. Create a directory to house your builds, ~/x-devel/build is
       recommended:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ mkdir build

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    3. Change the current directory to your build directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cd build

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    4. Create a directory for your standard build, std is recommended:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$ mkdir std

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    5. Change the current directory to your standard build directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$ cd std

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/std
$

    6. Create symlinks to your source tree, using lndir, in your standard
       build directory:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, creating symlinks to the source tree
     creates 11,664 files in 1,510 folders, which is only 2.24 MB of
     data, but requires 45.5 MB of storage space on a file system using
     4 KB allocation units.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/std
$ lndir ../../xc/
../../xc/config:
../../../xc/config/cf:

...

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/std
$

    7. Run a standard build of the entire tree, which takes between 30
       minutes and 5 hours, saving the output of the build commands to
       World.log:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, a standard build of the entire tree
     requires 255.5 MB of storage space on a file system using 4 KB
     allocation units; that is in addition to the 45.5 MB of previously
     generated symlinks.
     As a benchmark, a standard build runs for 71 minutes on a machine
     with a 1.2 GHz Atlhon, 256 MB DDR RAM, and a 7200 RPM ATA/100 HD.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/std
$ make World > World.log 2>&1

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/std
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Debug Build

   Follow these steps to create a build with debugging information:
    1. Change the current directory to your XFree86 development
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    2. If you have not already done so, create a directory to house your
       builds, ~/x-devel/build is recommended:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ mkdir build

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    3. Change the current directory to your build directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cd build

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    4. Create a directory for your debug build, debug is recommended:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$ mkdir debug

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$

    5. Change the current directory to your debug build directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build
$ cd debug

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/debug
$

    6. Create links to your source tree, using lndir, in your standard
       build directory:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, creating symlinks to the source tree
     creates 11,664 files in 1,510 folders, which is only 2.24 MB of
     data, but requires 45.5 MB of storage space on a file system using
     4 KB allocation units.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/debug
$ lndir ../../xc/
../../xc/config:
../../../xc/config/cf:

...

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/debug
$

    7. Run a debug build of the entire tree, which takes between 30
       minutes and 5 hours, saving the output of the build commands to
       World.log:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, a debug build of the entire tree requires
     566.5 MB of storage space on a file system using 4 KB allocation
     units; that is in addition to the 45.5 MB of previously generated
     symlinks.
     As a benchmark, a debug build runs for 71 minutes on a machine with
     a 1.2 GHz Atlhon, 256 MB DDR RAM, and a 7200 RPM ATA/100 HD. You
     may have noticed that the standard build time and the debug build
     time are identical.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/debug
$ ./config/util/makeg.sh World > World.log 2>&1

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/debug
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing a local build

   Installing a local build enables you to verify that a build of the
   entire source tree is operational. It is wise to verify the operation
   of full builds of the source tree from time to time, as full builds
   will occasionally be broken by changes that other developers are
   making to the XFree86 source code tree.

   Installing a local build on top of an existing build is not a good
   idea, as this can mask problems that occured during the build process,
   or it can cause problems that are unrelated to the build process;
   either situation is undesireable. It is generally a good idea to move
   your old installation out of the way before installing a local build,
   and these instructions will assume that you desire to do so. Follow
   the instructions below to install a local build:
    1. Move the /etc/X11 directory to /etc/X11_build-prefix_date_time:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ mv /etc/X11 /etc/X11_build-prefix_date_time

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    2. Move the /usr/X11R6 diretory to /usr/X11R6_build-prefix_date_time:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ mv /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11R6_build-prefix_date_time

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    3. Change the current directory to your desired XFree86 build
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix
$

    4. Make the install target, which installs binaries, fonts,
       libraries, and configuration files; in short, install installs
       everything except the man pages:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, the install target copies 5,074 files in 83
     folders into /usr/X11R6, requiring 89.2 MB of storage space for a
     standard build or 177 MB of storage space for a debug build, and
     276 files in 39 folders into /etc/X11, requiring 2.57 MB of storage
     space. All stated storage requirements are for a file system using
     4 KB allocation units.
     As a benchmark, install runs for 20 minutes on a machine with a 1.2
     GHz Atlhon, 256 MB DDR RAM, and a 7200 RPM ATA/100 HD. Standard and
     debug installs both complete in the stated time.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix
$ make install > install.log 2>&1

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix
$

    5. Make the install.man target, which only installs the man pages:

     Note: As of 2001-06-12, the install.man target copies 541 files in
     3 folders into /usr/X11R6/man, requiring 4.22 MB of storage space,
     and 544 files in 1 folder into /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc, requiring
     4.76 MB of storage space. All stated storage requirements are for a
     file system using 4 KB allocation units.
     As a benchmark, install.man runs for 2 minutes on a machine with a
     1.2 GHz Atlhon, 256 MB DDR RAM, and a 7200 RPM ATA/100 HD.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix
$ make install.man > install.man.log 2>&1

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/build/build-prefix
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Keeping your source code tree updated

   [39]CVS makes keeping your source code tree up to date easy. You may
   update your entire source code tree at once, or you can update
   individual directories or files, if you so choose.
     _________________________________________________________________

Update the entire source code tree

    1. Change the current directory to your XFree86 development
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    2. Change the current directory to the root of the XFree86 source
       code tree, xc/:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cd xc

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc
$

    3. To update your entire XFree86 source code tree, run the following
       command:

     Tip: The -zn parameter specifies the compression level to use, from
     1 to 9, with 9 being maximum compression.
     The -d parameter instructs cvs to rebuild the directory list, which
     causes new directories in the source code tree to be downloaded
     (new directories are skipped if you do not specify -d).

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc
$ cvs -z4 update -d

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Update a single file or directory

    1. Change the current directory to your XFree86 development
       directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$

    2. Change the current directory to the directory that contains the
       file you wish to update, or change the current directory to the
       directory that you wish to update:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel
$ cd xc/directory_to_update

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc/directory_to_update
$

    3. To update a single file, or a set of specified files, run the
       following command:

     Tip: The -zn parameter specifies the compression level to use, from
     1 to 9, with 9 being maximum compression.

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc/directory_to_update
$ cvs -z4 update filename_1 [filename_2 ...]

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc/directory_to_update
$

    4. To update a single directory, and its subdirectories, run the
       following command:

     Note: The -zn parameter specifies the compression level to use,
     from 1 to 9, with 9 being maximum compression.
     The -d parameter instructs cvs to rebuild the directory list, which
     causes new directories in the source code tree to be downloaded
     (new directories are skipped if you do not specify -d).

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc/directory_to_update
$ cvs -z4 update -d

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~/x-devel/xc/directory_to_update
$
     _________________________________________________________________

Cross Compiling

Obtaining binutils and gcc Source

   binutils and gcc source code releases that are known to compile on
   Cygwin and distributed by the Cygwin project. Therefore, it is highly
   recommended that you obtain the binutils and gcc sources from the
   [40]Cygwin mirror network.

   Follow these steps to download Cygwin/XFree86 binaries:
    1. Create a directory to store the binutils and gcc sources in, such
       as /cygwin/src/
    2. Visit the [41]Cygwin mirrors page to find your closest mirror
    3. The ftp url for your mirror site should take you to the cygwin/
       directory on the mirror
    4. Download the following files from cygwin/, saving them to
       /cygwin/src/ The compressed file size appears after each file in
       the list below.

     Downloading with a Web Browser: Some web browsers automatically
     decompress saved files when you use the left mouse button to follow
     the link to a file; bunzip2 will report, "Data integrity error when
     decompressing.", when attempting to decompress a file that has been
     decompressed by your web browser. Prevent your files from being
     automatically decompressed by clicking the right mouse button on a
     file link and choosing a command such as Save Target As... or Save
     Link As... from the context sensitive menu. Better yet, download
     your files with a stand alone ftp client.
          + binutils/binutils-20010425-2-src.tar.gz (9.1 MB; required,
            necessary to build gcc and Cygwin/XFree86)
          + gcc/gcc-2.95.3-5-src.tar.bz2 (8.1 MB; required, necessary to
            build Cygwin/XFree86)
     _________________________________________________________________

Obtaining Cygwin Headers and Libs

   The simplest method of building a cross compiler for Cygwin requires
   that you have the Cygwin headers and libraries available at the time
   of building the cross compiler. Cygwin headers and libraries are
   installed when Cygwin is installed, so the headers and libraries can
   be obtained from an existing Cygwin installation.

     Don't simply copy the headers and libraries: Some of the headers
     and libraries are symbolic links to other headers or libraries.
     Copying these files using a program that is not aware of Cygwin's
     symlink emulation will result in some of the header and library
     files being broken. The method described below will preserve the
     symbolic links used by the header and library files.

    1. Launch your Cygwin environment, using either the icon on your
       Desktop, the icon in your Start Menu, or by running cygwin.bat
       from your Cygwin directory (e.g. c:\cygwin); you should see a
       window like the following:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$

    2. Change the current directory to Cygwin root directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost ~
$ cd /

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    3. Create an archive of the contents of the /lib directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$ tar -czf cygwin-lib.tgz lib/

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$

    4. Change the current directory to the usr directory in your Cygwin
       root directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /
$ cd /usr

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr
$

    5. Create an archive of the contents of the /usr/include directory:

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr
$ tar -czf cygwin-include.tgz include/

Harold@MyWindowsHost /usr
$

    6. Transfer cygwin-lib.tgz and cygwin-include.tgz to your build host
       using any method that you have available (e.g. ftp, samba,
       diskette, etc.). Save the files in the /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/
       directory.
    7. Open a shell on your cross compiling build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

[harold@MyCrossHost harold]$

    8. Change the current directory to the /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/
       directory in your build host root directory:

[harold@MyCrossHost harold]$ cd /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/
[harold@MyCrossHost /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$

    9. Extract the cygwin-lib.tgz and cygwin-include.tgz archives:

[harold@MyCrossHost /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$ tar -xzf cygwin-lib.tgz
[harold@MyCrossHost /cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$ tar -xzf cygwin-include.tgz
     _________________________________________________________________

Building binutils and gcc

    1. Open a shell on your cross compiling build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

[harold@MyCrossHost harold]$

    2. Change the current directory to the /cygwin/src/ directory in your

Glossary

C

   Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
          CVS is an open source version control system used by the
          majority of open source projects. More information can be found
          at the [42]CVS project homepage.

F

   firewall
          Firewall software attempts to protect an internal network from
          intrusions originating from an external network.

P

   pserver
          CVS pserver, short for "password server", is one of the user
          authentication methods supported by CVS. CVS pserver is not
          secure, as passwords are transmitted and stored as plain text.
          However, CVS pserver is desireable for read-only anonymous
          access to open source CVS trees, as CVS pserver is by far the
          easiest method to use.

V

   Virtual Private Network (VPN)
          Virtual Private Networks are encrypted tunnels through which
          private data can be safely transmitted over a private network
          (e.g. the Internet).

X

   X Display Manager (XDM)
          An X Display Manager presents a graphical login screen to X
          users. Often an XDM will allow the user to select a desktop
          environment or window manager to be for their login session.
          Some X Display Managers are xdm, gdm (Gnome Display Manager),
          and kdm (KDE Display Manager).

   X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)
          XDMCP allows XDM to process logins for users remote to the
          machine that XDM is running on; login sessions will be run on
          the machine running XDM. For example, at a university you may
          use XDMCP to login to an X session running on an engineering
          department computer from your dorm room.

          See Also: [43]X Display Manager.

Appendix A. GNU Free Documentation License

   Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
     Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
     and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
     changing it is not allowed.
     _________________________________________________________________

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [44]http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
