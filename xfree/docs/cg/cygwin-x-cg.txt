Chapter 1. Overview

   The Cygwin/X project can use your help! We will do everything we can to
   make experienced contributors productive as soon as possible. We also
   want to make it as easy as possible for new contributers to make
   Cygwin/X their first open source project.

   Anyone who despaired of touching the monolithic tree will find things
   much easier now with modular X. If you want to see Cygwin/X stay
   current and add new features, then WE NEED YOU.

   Cygwin/X is part of the vast number of open source/free software
   programs that provide compatibility with closed source/commercial
   software products. Cygwin/X enables the coexistence of closed software
   and open software during the period of transition from an almost
   completely closed software market to an almost completely open software
   market.

   Join in the excitement of opening your Windows machine to the X Window
   System.

   We need [47]programmers, [48]documentation writers, and [49]website
   maintainers.

Chapter 2. Programming

Overview

   This chapter provides a consolidated overview of all of the information
   needed to begin making source code contributions to Cygwin/X. Creating
   a source code contribution for Cygwin/X requires an amazingly small
   amount of information; however, prior to this document that tiny amount
   of information was difficult to obtain, as it was scattered across
   several documents and source code files. New programmers with no open
   source project experience, as well as programming gurus, will be able
   to make source code contributions to Cygwin/X after reading this
   chapter. Programming gurus are great; our intention is to create more
   of them.

   This document is primarily focused on the Cygwin/X server; most other
   components are extremely stable and work out-of-the-box on Cygwin

   The primary source of information on developing for X is the [50]X.Org
   developer startpage

   Downloading the X Window System source code tree can take anywhere from
   10 minutes to 10 hours, depending upon the speed of your network
   connection. If you have an active network connection at your disposal
   you may want to skip ahead to [51]the Section called Obtaining the
   Source Code and start downloading the source code tree now. You will
   find it advantageous to have a source code tree as you read the other
   sections.

Source Code Tree Layout

   Descriptions of Important xserver Directories and Subdirectories
     * cfb* contains deprecated [52]color framebuffer drawing procedures
       that are not compatible with the [53]Shadow drawing system that
       Cygwin/X depends upon. This directory is of no interest to Cygwin/X
       programmers.
     * dix contains [drawing] [54]device independent X routines. main.c
       contains the main entry-point function for the Cygwin/X X Server.
       The X Server startup procedure can be followed by examining main.
     * fb contains the modern framebuffer drawing procedures used by
       Cygwin/X. This directory is maintained by Keith Packard and is only
       of interest to Cygwin/X programmers when it fails to build.
     * hw contains [drawing] hardware dependent functions.
          + vfb contains the Virtual Framebuffer X Server. The vfb server
            draws to a system memory framebuffer with the primary purpose
            of allowing X clients to run on a machine that does not have
            display hardware.
          + xfree86 contains source code for the X Window System servers
            that run on various operating systems that generally have
            low-level access to the graphics hardware. Cygwin/X does not
            have low-level access to the graphics hardware, thus Cygwin/X
            is not able to utilize the X Window System server.
          + xnest contains source code for the Nested X Server which runs
            inside of another X Server. xnest is not generally of interest
            to Cygwin/X programmers.
          + xwin contains the source code for the Cygwin/X X Server. This
            is the primary directory that Cygwin/X programmers are
            interested in.
     * include contains header files specific to the X Server program,
       such as graphics context structures. This directory is useful to
       Cygwin/X programmers when they need to lookup the name or data type
       of members of various X Server structures.
     * mi contains [55]machine independent drawing routines. These drawing
       routines are used by the Cygwin/X Native GDI X Server engine. In
       turn, the machine independent routines depend in winGetSpans,
       winFillSpans, and winSetSpans, which are implemented in the Native
       GDI engine.
     * miext contains various machine independent X extensions.
          + layer contains source code for the layer extension. This
            extension is supported by Cygwin/X, however, this directory
            will be of interest only when layer fails to build.
          + shadow contains source code for the shadow extension that the
            Cygwin/X X Server depends upon. This directory is of primary
            importance to Cygwin/X, but it is maintained by other
            programmers and is only of direct interest to Cygwin/X
            programmers when it fails to build. The shadow extension does
            three things:
              1. Allows the fb graphics routines to draw to an offscreen
                 framebuffer.
              2. Keeps track of the regions of the offscreen framebuffer
                 that have been drawn on.
              3. Calls one of Cygwin/X's engine dependent ShadowUpdate ()
                 functions to transfer the updated regions of the
                 offscreen framebuffer to the screen.
     * os contains [56]operating system dependent X Server functions.
       However, the functions in the os have been written in such a way
       that they are actually compatible with most UNIX-style operating
       systems, include Cygwin.

   Other components of interest
     * doc
          + hardcopy contains precompiled PostScript documentation for
            various components of the X Window System. Cygwin/X-specific
            documentation is not contained in this directory. This
            directory is of little interest to Cygwin/X programmers.
          + specs contains the sources to build the documents in hardcopy.
            This directory is of little interest to Cygwin/X programmers.
     * fonts contains font definition files used to compile fonts. This
       directory is of little interest to Cygwin/X programmers.
     * include contains various X Window System headers that are not
       generally specific to any one client or library (i.e. X.h,
       Xproto.h, and keysymdef.h).
     * lib contains both X client and X Server libraries. Cygwin/X does
       not generally call any functions in these libraries directly;
       however, we do have to link to several of these libraries to get
       our X Server to build. These libraries are maintained by various
       developers from the X Window System project and there are
       occasional synchronizations with [57]The Open Group's [58]X.org.
       Cygwin/X programmers occasionally need to fix Cygwin-related build
       errors that occur in these libraries.
     __________________________________________________________________

Cygwin/X X Server Architecture

   Cygwin/X's X Server architecture was heavily inspired by
   [59]Angebranndt94, the Definition of the Porting Layer for the X v11
   Sample Server.
     __________________________________________________________________

Server Privates

   X Servers use various structures to pass information around to
   functions. Some of those structures are colormaps, [60]graphics
   contexts (GCs), [61]pixmaps, and [62]screens. The X protocol defines
   the contents of each of these structures, however, the X Server
   implementation and various X Server libraries ([63]MI, [64]FB,
   [65]Shadow, etc.) may require additional information to be associated
   with these internal structures. For example, the Cygwin/X X Server must
   associate a Windows window handle (hwnd) with each X Server screen that
   is open.

   [66]Privates are the mechanism provided by the X protocol for
   associating additional information with internal X Server structures.
   Privates originally consisted of a single pointer member contained in
   each structure, usually named devPrivate or devPriv. This original
   specification only allowed one of the X Server layers (mi, fb, shadow,
   etc.) to have privates associated with an internal structure. Privates
   have since been revised.

   The current privates implementation requires that each X Server layer
   call a function on startup to indicate that that layer will require
   privates and to obtain an index into the array of privates that that
   layer's privates will be stored at. Modern privates are generally
   stored in an array of type DevUnion pointed to by a structure member
   named devPrivates; DevUnion is defined in xserver/include/miscstruct.h.
   There are two different memory allocation schemes for devPrivates.

   Memory for privates structures can either be preallocated or allocated
   upon use. Preallocation, the preferred method for GCs, pixmaps, and
   windows, requires that the size of the privates memory needed be
   specified during X Server initialization. Preallocation allows the
   [67]DIX layer to allocate all memory needed for a given internal
   structure, including all privates memory, as a single contiguous block
   of memory; this greatly reduces memory fragmentation. Allocation upon
   use, used by screens, requires the [68]DDX structure creation function
   to allocate memory for the privates; winScreenInit calling
   winAllocatePrivates, which allocates screen privates memory directly,
   is an example of this. Allocation upon use can optionally and
   non-optimally be used by GCs, pixmaps, and windows.
     __________________________________________________________________

Macros

   Three macros are provided for each class of privates that make setting
   up and using the privates easier. The macros for screen privates are
   examined as an example.

   winPrivScreenPtr winGetScreenPriv(ScreenPtr pScreen);

   winGetScreenPriv takes a non-NULL pointer to a screen, a ScreenPtr, and
   returns the pointer stored in the DDX privates for that screen. Passing
   a NULL or invalid ScreenPtr to winGetScreenPriv will cause an access
   violation, crashing the Cygwin/X X Server.

   void winSetScreenPriv(ScreenPtr pScreen, void * pvPrivates);

   winSetScreenPriv takes a non-NULL pointer to a screen, a ScreenPtr, and
   sets the DDX privates pointer to the value of the pvPrivates parameter.
   Passing a NULL or invalid ScreenPtr to winSetScreenPriv will cause an
   access violation, crashing the Cygwin/X X Server.

   void winScreenPriv(ScreenPtr pScreen);

   winScreenPriv takes a non-NULL pointer to a screen, a ScreenPtr, and
   declares a local variable in the calling function named pScreenPriv.
   winScreenPriv may only be called at the top of a C function within the
   variable declaration block; calling the function elsewhere will break
   the ANSI C rule that all variables must be declared at the top of a
   scope block. Passing a NULL or invalid ScreenPtr to winScreenPriv will
   cause an access violation, crashing the Cygwin/X X Server.
     __________________________________________________________________

Engine System

   The Cygwin/X X Server uses several methods of drawing graphics on the
   display device; each of these different drawing methods is referred to
   as an engine. Each of the engines can be classified as either a Shadow
   FB engine, a Native GDI engine, or as a Primary FB engine. It should be
   noted that the Primary FB engine is deprecated and is discussed here
   only for completeness. The engines are discussed in the following
   sections, in order of importance.
     __________________________________________________________________

Shadow FB Engines

   The Shadow FB engines use Keith Packard's [69]FB drawing procedures
   wrapped with his [70]Shadow layer that allows drawing to an
   [71]offscreen framebuffer with periodic updates of the [72]primary
   framebuffer.
     __________________________________________________________________

Native GDI Engine

   The Native GDI engine will eventually translate individual X graphics
   calls into their GDI equivalent. Some X graphics calls do not translate
   directly to a GDI call so they may be passed through the MI layer to
   change them into a serious of lower level calls that are supported.
   Currently, the Native GDI engine passes all X graphics calls through
   the MI layer to convert them into three functions: FillSpans, GetSpans,
   and SetSpans. The functionality of those three functions, as of
   2001-10-28, is limited to the functionality needed to draw the familiar
   X background pattern upon X Server startup.
     __________________________________________________________________

Primary FB Engine

   The Primary FB engine is deprecated. Primary FB works in the same
   manner that the original Cygwin/X X Server worked, namely, it uses
   IDirectDrawSurface_Lock to obtain a pointer to the [73]primary
   framebuffer memory at server startup. This memory pointer is held until
   the X Server shuts down. This technique does not work on all versions
   of Windows.

   Locking the primary framebuffer on Windows 95/98/Me causes the
   Win16Mutex to be obtained by the program that locks the primary
   framebuffer; the Win16Mutex is not released until the primary
   framebuffer is unlocked. The Win16Mutex is a semaphore introduced in
   Windows 95 that prevents 16 bit Windows code from being reentered by
   different threads or processes. For compatibility reasons, all GDI
   operations in Windows 95/98/Me are written in 16 bit code, thus
   requiring that the Win16Mutex be obtained before performing those
   operations. All of this leads to the following situation on Windows
   95/98/Me:
    1. The primary framebuffer is locked, causing the Cygwin/X X Server to
       hold the Win16Mutex.
    2. Windows switches the Cygwin/X X Server out of the current process
       slot; another process is switched in.
    3. The newly selected process makes a GDI function call.
    4. The GDI function call must wait for the Win16Mutex to be released,
       but the Win16Mutex cannot be released until the Cygwin/X X Server
       releases the Win16Mutex. However, the Cygwin/X X Server will not
       release the Win16Mutex until it exits. The end result is that the
       Win16Mutex has been deadlocked and the Windows machine is frozen
       with no way to recover.

   Windows NT/2000/XP do not contain any 16 bit code, so the Win16Mutex is
   not an issue; thus, the Primary FB engine works fine on those operating
   systems. However, drawing directly to the primary framebuffer suffers
   performance problems. For example, on some systems writing to the
   primary framebuffer requires doing memory reads and writes across the
   PCI bus which is only 32 bits wide and features a clock speed of 33
   MHz, as opposed to accessing system memory, which is attached to a 64
   bit wide bus that runs at between 100 and 266 (effective) MHz.
   Furthermore, accessing the primary framebuffer memory requires several
   synchronization steps that take many clock cycles to complete. The end
   result is that the Primary FB engine is several times slower than the
   Shadow FB engines.

   The Primary FB engine also has several unique issues that are difficult
   to program around. Development of the Primary FB engine has ceased, due
   to the difficulty of maintaining it, coupled with the fact that Primary
   FB does not run on Windows 95/98/Me and with the poor performance of
   Primary FB. The Primary FB source code has been left in place so that
   future programmers can enable it and see the poor performance of the
   engine for themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

User Input

   User input is processed using the [74]MI layer's user input system. Any
   queued Win32 user input messages, as well as other Win32 messages, are
   handled when hw/xwin/winwakeup.c's winWakeupHandler function is called
   by the [75]OS layer os/WaitFor.c's WaitForSomething function and when
   the [76]DIX layer dix/dispatch.c's Dispatch function calls
   hw/xwin/InitInput.c's ProcessInputEvents function. Each Win32 user
   input message typically queues an input event, or several input events,
   using the MI layer's mi/mieq.c's mieqEnqueue function. Enqueued MI
   input events are processed in ProcessInputEvents by calling mi/mieq.c's
   mieqProcessInputEvents; the cursor position is updated on the screen by
   calling mipointer.c's miPointerUpdate.
     __________________________________________________________________

Keyboard

   Win32 keyboard messages are processed in winwndproc.c's winWindowProc.
   The messages processed are:
     * WM_SYSKEYDOWN
     * WM_KEYDOWN
     * WM_SYSKEYUP
     * WM_KEYUP

   The WM_SYSKEY* messages are generated when the user presses a key while
   holding down the Alt key or when the user presses a key after pressing
   and releasing the F10 key. Processing for WM_SYSKEYDOWN and WM_KEYDOWN
   (respectively WM_SYSKEYUP, WM_KEYUP) messages are identical because the
   X Server does not distinguish between a normal key press and a key
   press when the Alt key is down.

   Win32 uses virtual key codes to identify which key is being pressed or
   released. Virtual key codes follow the idea that the same virtual key
   code will be sent for keys with the same label printed on them. For
   example, the left and right Ctrl keys both generate the VK_CONTROL
   virtual key code. Virtual key codes are accompanied by other state
   information, such as the extended flag, that distinguishes between the
   multiple keys with the same label. For example, the left Ctrl key does
   not have the extended flag asserted, while the right Ctrl key does have
   the extended flag asserted. However, virtual key codes are not the way
   that key presses have traditionally been identified on personal
   computers and in the X Protocol.

   Personal computers and the X Protocol use scan codes to identify which
   key is being pressed. Each key on the keyboard generates a specified
   number when that key is pressed or released; this number is called the
   scan code. Scan codes are always distinct for distinct keys. For
   example, the left and right Ctrl keys generate distinct scan codes,
   even though their functionality is the same. Scan codes do not have
   additional state information, as the multiple keys with the same label
   will each generate a unique scan code. There is some debate as to which
   of virtual key codes or scan codes is the better system.

   The X Protocol expects that keyboard input will be based on a scan code
   system. There are two methods of sending a scan codes from a virtual
   key code message. The first method is to create a static table that
   links the normal and extended state of each virtual key code to a scan
   code. This method seems valid, but the method does not work reliably
   for users with non-U.S. keyboard layouts. The second method simply
   pulls the scan code out of the lParam of the keyboard messages; this
   method works reliably for non-U.S. keyboard layouts. However, there are
   further concerns for non-U.S. keyboard layouts.

   Non-U.S. keyboard layouts typically use the right Alt key as a sort of
   shift key to access an additional row of symbols from the `, 1, 2, ...,
   0 keys, as well as accented forms of standard alphabetic characters,
   such as á, ä, å, ú and additional alphabetic characters, such as ß.
   Non-U.S. keyboards typically label the right Alt key as AltGr or
   AltLang; the Gr is short for "grave", which is the name of one of the
   accent symbols. The X Protocol and Win32 methods of handling the AltGr
   key are not directly compatible with one another.

   The X Protocol handles AltGr presses and releases in much the same way
   as any other key press and release. Win32, however, generates a fake
   Ctrl press and release for each AltGr press and release. The X Protocol
   does not expect this fake Ctrl press and release, so care must be taken
   to discard the fake Ctrl press and release. Fake Ctrl presses and
   releases are detected and discarded by passing each keyboard message to
   winkeybd.c's winIsFakeCtrl_L function. winIsFakeCtrl_L detects the fake
   key presses and releases by comparing the timestamps of the AltGr
   message with the timestamp of any preceding or trailing Ctrl message.
   Two real key events will never have the same timestamp, but the fake
   key events have the same timestamp as the AltGr messages, so the fake
   messages can be easily identified.

   Special keyboard considerations must be handled the Cygwin/X X Server
   losses or gains the keyboard focus. For example, the user can switch
   out of Cygwin/X, toggle the Num Lock key, then switch back into
   Cygwin/X; in this case Cygwin/X would not have received the Num Lock
   toggle message, so it will continue to function as if Num Lock was in
   its previous state. Thus, the state of any mode keys such as Num Lock,
   Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, and Kana Lock must be stored upon loss of
   keyboard focus; the stored state of each mode key must then be compared
   to that key's current state, toggling the key if its state has changed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Mouse

   Win32 mouse messages are processed in winwndproc.c's winWindowProc. The
   messages processed are:
     * WM_MOUSEMOVE
     * WM_NCMOUSEMOVE
     * WM_LBUTTON*
     * WM_MBUTTON*
     * WM_RBUTTON*
     * WM_MOUSEWHEEL

   Handling mouse motion is relatively straight forward, with the special
   consideration that the Windows mouse cursor must be hidden when the
   mouse is moving over the client area of a Cygwin/X window; the Windows
   mouse cursor must be redisplayed when the mouse is moving over the
   non-client area of a Cygwin/X window. Win32 sends the absolute
   coordinates of the mouse, so we call miPointerAbsoluteCursor to change
   the position of the mouse.

   Three-button mouse emulation is supported for users that do not have a
   three button mouse. When three-button mouse emulation is disabled,
   mouse button presses and releases are handled trivially in winmouse.c's
   winMouseButtonsHandle by simply passing the event to mieqEnqueue.
   Three-button mouse emulation is quite complicated.

   Three-button mouse emulation is handled by starting a timer when the
   left or right mouse buttons are pressed; the button event is sent as a
   left or right mouse button event if the other button is not pressed
   before the timer expires. The button event is sent as an emulated
   middle button event if the other mouse button is pressed before the
   timer runs out.

   The mouse wheel is handled in winmouse.c's winMouseWheel by generating
   sequences of button 4 and button 5 presses and releases corresponding
   to how much the mouse wheel has moved. Win32 uses variable resolution
   for the mouse wheel and passes the mouse wheel motion as a delta from
   the wheel's previous position. The number of button clicks to send is
   determined by dividing the wheel delta by the distance that is
   considered by Win32 to be one unit of motion for the mouse wheel; any
   remainder of the wheel delta must be preserved and added to the next
   mouse wheel message.
     __________________________________________________________________

Obtaining the Source Code

   Cygwin/X source code is contained in, and distributed with, the X
   Window System source code tree.

   The source code for the packages distributed via Cygwin setup is also
   available via Cygwin setup. This may have multiple patches applied on
   top of the X Window System source code, and should be the starting
   point for new developers.

   Read-only [77]git access to the X Window System source tree is also
   available.

   The CYGWIN branch exists in git for historical reasons. Current
   development follows the mainline.

$ git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/xserver
     __________________________________________________________________

Native Compiling

Compiling the Source Code

   Compiling Cygwin/X doesn't have to be hard, although the X Window
   System source code tree is reasonably large. There are a few simple
   techniques that make building the source code, keeping the source code
   up to date, and keeping the source code organized much easier.
     __________________________________________________________________

Required Packages for Compiling

   Many developer libraries and developer tools are required to build
   Cygwin/X. Several packages are required in addition to the default
   packages installed by the Cygwin installer. Following is a list of
   additional packages that are required to compile Cygwin/X natively in
   Cygwin. Note that some of these packages are meta packages that will
   automatically cause several other packages to be selected for
   installation; do not unselect any of these automatically selected
   packages.
     * autoconf
     * automake
     * binutils
     * bzip2
     * diffutils
     * fileutils
     * findutils
     * flex
     * gawk
     * gcc
     * git
     * make
     * patch
     * sed
     * tar
     * zlib
     __________________________________________________________________

Standard Build

   Follow these steps to create a standard, non-debug, build:
    1. Change the current directory to your X Window System development
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
[lots of output]
$ make
[lots more output]


       Standard build is now complete.

     Note: XXX: Add figures for normal diskspace occupied by source,
     additional diskspace occupied by build, and a benchmark time for the
     build to complete
     XXX: Describe configure option for specifying a builddir
     __________________________________________________________________

Debug Build

   Follow these steps to create a build with debugging information:
    1. Change the current directory to your X Window System development
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd x-devel

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug CFLAGS="-g -O0"
[lots of output]
$ make
[lots more

       Debug build is now complete.
     __________________________________________________________________

Running a local build

   Follow these steps to run the built X server:
    1. Change the current directory to your X Window System development
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd xserver
Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver
$

    2. Invoke the hw/xwin/Xwin executable:

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver
$ hw/xwin/XWin

       The X server you have built will now attempt to run.
     __________________________________________________________________

Installing a local build

   Installing a local build enables you to verify that a build of the
   entire source tree is operational. It is wise to verify the operation
   of full builds of the source tree from time to time, as full builds
   will occasionally be broken by changes that other developers are making
   to the X Window System source code tree.

   Installing a local build on top of an existing build is not a good
   idea, as this can mask problems that occurred during the build process,
   or it can cause problems that are unrelated to the build process;
   either situation is undesirable. It is generally a good idea to move
   your old installation out of the way before installing a local build,
   and these instructions will assume that you desire to do so. Follow the
   instructions below to install a local build:
    1. Change the current directory to your desired X Window System build
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd ~/xserver/build/build-prefix

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver/build/build-prefix
$

    2. Make the install target, which installs everything:

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver/build/build-prefix
$ make install

Username@CygwinHost ~/xserver/build/build-prefix
$

Keeping your source code tree updated

   [78]git makes keeping your source code tree up to date easy. Consult
   the git documentation for details.
     __________________________________________________________________

Cross Compiling

   Cross compiling is the act of the building source code on one system,
   the build host, into executables or libraries to be run on a different
   host, the native host. The build host and the native host may differ in
   operating system and/or processor type. Cross compiling is done for
   several reasons:
     * The native host is grossly under powered, such as a handheld
       computer.
     * The user happens to have greatly more compiling power available on
       a platform other than the native host. For example, the user may
       have access to a 32 processor machine while their desktop machine
       may only be a uni-processor machine.

   Cross compiling is much trickier than building on the native host.
   There are a whole new class of problems that can happen when cross
   compiling that are simply not an issue when building on Cygwin. You
   should be familiar with building Cygwin/X on Cygwin, as described in
   [79]the Section called Native Compiling, before attempting to cross
   compile Cygwin/X.
     __________________________________________________________________

Obtaining binutils and gcc Source

   binutils and gcc source code releases that are known to compile on
   Cygwin are distributed by the Cygwin project. Therefore, it is highly
   recommended that you obtain the binutils and gcc sources from the
   [80]Cygwin mirror network.

   Follow these steps to download Cygwin/X binaries:
    1. Create a directory to store the binutils and gcc sources in, such
       as /home/my_login/cygwin/src/
    2. Visit the [81]Cygwin mirrors page to find your closest mirror
    3. The ftp url for your mirror site should take you to the cygwin/
       directory on the mirror
    4. Change current ftp directory to cygwin/release/.
    5. Download the following files from cygwin/release/, saving them to
       /home/my_login/cygwin/src/ The compressed file size appears after
       each file in the list below.

     Downloading with a Web Browser: Some web browsers automatically
     decompress saved files when you use the left mouse button to follow
     the link to a file; bunzip2 will report, "Data integrity error when
     decompressing.", when attempting to decompress a file that has been
     decompressed by your web browser. Prevent your files from being
     automatically decompressed by clicking the right mouse button on a
     file link and choosing a command such as Save Target As... or Save
     Link As... from the context sensitive menu. Better yet, download
     your files with a stand alone ftp client.
          + binutils/binutils-20030901-1-src.tar.bz2 (10.5 MiB; required,
            necessary to build gcc and Cygwin/X)
          + gcc/gcc-3.3.1-1-src.tar.bz2 (21.9 MiB; required, necessary to
            build Cygwin/X)
     __________________________________________________________________

Obtaining Cygwin Headers and Libs

   The simplest method of building a cross compiler for Cygwin requires
   that you have the Cygwin headers and libraries available at the time of
   building the cross compiler. Cygwin headers and libraries are installed
   when Cygwin is installed, so the headers and libraries can be obtained
   from an existing Cygwin installation.

     Don't simply copy the headers and libraries: Some of the headers and
     libraries are symbolic links to other headers or libraries. Copying
     these files using a program that is not aware of Cygwin's symlink
     emulation will result in some of the header and library files being
     broken. The method described below will preserve the symbolic links
     used by the header and library files.

    1. Launch your Cygwin environment, using either the icon on your
       Desktop, the icon in your Start Menu, or by running cygwin.bat from
       your Cygwin directory (e.g. c:\cygwin); you should see a window
       like the following:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$

    2. Change the current directory to Cygwin root directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd /

Username@CygwinHost /
$

    3. Create an archive of the contents of the /lib directory:

Username@CygwinHost /
$ tar czf cygwin-lib.tgz lib/

Username@CygwinHost /
$

    4. Change the current directory to the usr directory in your Cygwin
       root directory:

Username@CygwinHost /
$ cd /usr

Username@CygwinHost /usr
$

    5. Create an archive of the contents of the /usr/include directory:

Username@CygwinHost /usr
$ tar czf cygwin-include.tgz include/

Username@CygwinHost /usr
$

    6. Transfer cygwin-lib.tgz and cygwin-include.tgz to your build host
       using any method that you have available (e.g. ftp, samba,
       diskette, etc.). Save the files in the
       /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/ directory.
    7. Open a shell on your cross compiling build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

[harold@CrossHost harold]$

    8. Change the current directory to the
       /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/ directory in your build host
       root directory:

[harold@CrossHost harold]$ cd /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/

[harold@CrossHost /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$

    9. Extract the cygwin-lib.tgz and cygwin-include.tgz archives:

[harold@CrossHost /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$ tar xzf cygwin-lib.tgz

[harold@CrossHost /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/]$ tar xzf cygwin-include
.tgz

   10. Obtaining Cygwin headers and libs is now complete.
     __________________________________________________________________

Building binutils and gcc

    1. Open a shell on your cross compiling build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

[harold@CrossHost harold]$

    2. Change the current directory to the /home/my_login/cygwin/src/
       directory in your build host root directory:

[harold@CrossHost harold]$ cd /home/my_login/cygwin/src/

[harold@CrossHost src]$

    3. Extract the binutils-20030901-1-src.tar.bz2 and
       gcc-3.3.1-1-src.tar.bz2 archives:

[harold@CrossHost src]$ bunzip2 binutils-20030901-1-src.tar.bz2

[harold@CrossHost src]$ tar xf binutils-20030901-1-src.tar

[harold@CrossHost src]$ bunzip2 gcc-3.3.1-1-src.tar.bz2

[harold@CrossHost src]$ tar xf gcc-3.3.1-1-src.tar

    4. Change the current directory to the
       /home/my_login/cygwin/src/binutils-20030901-1 directory:

[harold@CrossHost src]$ cd binutils-20030901-1

[harold@CrossHost binutils-20030901-1]$


    5. Create a build directory and change the current directory to that
       directory:

[harold@CrossHost binutils-20030901-1]$ mkdir build

[harold@CrossHost binutils-20030901-1]$ cd build

[harold@CrossHost build]$

    6. Configure binutils:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ ../configure
--prefix=/home/my_login/cygwin --exec-prefix=/home/my_login/cygwin
--target=i686-pc-cygwin --host=i686-pc-linux > configure.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

    7. Build binutils:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ make all > all.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

    8. Install binutils:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ make install > install.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

    9. Modify the PATH environment variable to include the directories
       that the binutils executables were installed in:

[harold@CrossHost build]$
PATH=$PATH:/home/my_login/cygwin/bin:/home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/bin

[harold@CrossHost build]$

   10. Change the current directory to the
       /home/my_login/cygwin/src/gcc-3.3.1-1 directory:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ cd ../../gcc-3.3.1-1

[harold@CrossHost gcc-3.3.1-1]$

   11. Create a build directory and change the current directory to that
       directory:

[harold@CrossHost gcc-3.3.1-1]$ mkdir build

[harold@CrossHost gcc-3.3.1-1]$ cd build

[harold@CrossHost build]$

   12. Configure gcc:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ ../configure
--prefix=/home/my_login/cygwin --exec-prefix=/home/my_login/cygwin
--target=i686-pc-cygwin --host=i686-pc-linux
--enable-haifa > configure.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

   13. Build gcc:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ make all > all.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

   14. Install gcc:

[harold@CrossHost build]$ make install > install.log 2>&1

[harold@CrossHost build]$

   15. Building binutils and gcc is now complete.
     __________________________________________________________________

Creating Links for binutils and gcc

   Links to the executables in /home/my_login/cygwin/bin must be created
   in the /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/bin directory; these are
   required for the build system to find the build executables (e.g. gcc,
   cpp, etc.). Each of the build executables in /home/my_login/cygwin/bin
   is prefixed with i686-pc-cygwin (e.g. i686-pc-cygwin-cpp) whereas the
   build system expects the executables to have no prefix (e.g. cpp).

   Creating links to the build executables and dropping the prefix from
   the name of each build executables link is done by a script that was
   provided by the XFree86 cross-compiling community and slightly modified
   by Alexander Gottwald. The text of this script is below, save it in a
   file on your cross compiling host called cross-links.sh. Note that the
   location of the script does not matter, since it contains a reference
   to the location of the build tools in the CYGROOT variable.
#!/bin/bash

#
# This stuff is required for the Cross Compile Environment.
#
CYGROOT=/home/my_login/cygwin
TARGET=i686-pc-cygwin
mkdir -p $CYGROOT/$TARGET/bin
cd $CYGROOT/$TARGET/bin

for i in ../../bin/*; do
    if [ $i !=  ${i/$TARGET-/} ]; then
         ln -s $i ${i/.*$TARGET-/}
    fi
done

ln -s gcc cc

   Finally, run the cross-links.sh script. There should now be several
   links in the /home/my_login/cygwin/i686-pc-cygwin/bin directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

Building Cygwin/X

   Building the source code when cross compiling X Window System is nearly
   identical to the process described below in [82]the Section called
   Native Compiling of the Native Compiling section. One divergence from
   the aforementioned instructions is that you will be using a bash shell
   on your cross compiling host, rather than on your native Cygwin host;
   other divergences follow.

     Note: XXX: THIS IS UNTESTED

    1. When configuring, you must pass --target=i686-pc-cygwin to
       ./configure to cause the build system to build for the target,
       Cygwin, platform:
    2. When configuring, you must pass --prefix=/stagingdir to ./configure
       to cause the build system to be configured to install the target
       platform build into /stagingdir.
       OR, when installing a build, you must pass DESTDIR to make install
       to install the target platform build into /stagingdir.

     Tip: Never run make install on your host platform without the
     DESTDIR parameter, as that will cause the Cygwin build of X Window
     System to be installed over top of your local X Window System
     installation, which would completely destroy your host system's X
     Window System installation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Packaging a Cygwin/X Distribution

   Cygwin/X uses a cygport build and packaging script that automates all
   of the tasks required to build, create binary packages, and source code
   packages.

     Note: These instructions assume that you want to build a
     distribution from the source packages available from Cygwin's
     setup.exe.

     You can a similar technique to build a distribution from X.Org
     release tarballs instead.

    1. Unpack xorg-server-x.x.x-x-src.tar.bz2 (if you use setup to install
       this source package, it will be automatically unpacked under
       /usr/src)

Username@CygwinHost /usr/src
$ tar -jxf xorg-server-x.x.x-x-src.tar.bz2

    2. Invoke cygport on the .cygport file contained in the source package
       unpacked above. This will create the source and binary packages
       xorg-server-1.5.3-X-src.tar.bz2 and xorg-server-1.5.3-X.tar.bz2

Username@CygwinHost /usr/src
$ cygport xorg-server-x.x.x-x.cygport all
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Documentation

Overview

   Cygwin/X documentation is written in XML according to the [83]DocBook
   document type definition (DTD). These XML input files are then compiled
   using an autoconf and automake build system. We currently build the
   following output formats: HTML, PDF, PS, RTF, and TXT.
     __________________________________________________________________

Obtaining the Source Code

Source of latest cygwin-x-doc release

   To obtain the source of the latest release of the cygwin-x-doc package
   start the cygwin setup, select directories and mirror and select the
   package cygwin-x-doc from the category X11. Mark the checkbox labelled
   src and install. This will install the documentation source in
   /usr/cvs/cygwin-x-doc.
     __________________________________________________________________

Source from CVS

   The documentation source code is available from freedesktop.org cvs
   too. The obtain them please follow these rules:
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@pdx.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xserver login
CVS password: <hit return>
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@pdx.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xserver co cygwin-x-doc

   You should now have the sources in an directory called cygwin-x-doc.
     __________________________________________________________________

Setting Up a DocBook Build Environment

   Setup a DocBook build environment on Cygwin
     __________________________________________________________________

Required Packages for building documentation

     * openjade
     * jadetex (no offical package for this)
     * docbook-dsssl (no offical package for this and getting the
       stylesheets set up properly is a black art)

     Note: A useful, if slightly dated, introduction to setting up a
     docbook build environment and editing tools can be found in the
     [84]SGML for Windows NT: Setting up a free SGML editing and
     publishing system on Windows NT/Cygwin document.
     __________________________________________________________________

Building the Documentation

   Follow these instructions to build the Cygwin/X documentation source
   code:
    1. Open a shell on your documentation build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$

    2. Change the current directory to the documentation source code
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0
$

    3. Create a build directory and change the current directory to that
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0
$ mkdir build

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0
$ cd build

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$

    4. Configure the documentation source code:

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$ ../configure

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$

     Note: Use ./configure --enable-hardcopy to enable building of all
     documentation formats, otherwise just HTML will be built
    5. Build the documentation:

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$ make all

    6. Building the documentation is now complete.
     __________________________________________________________________

Packaging a Documentation Distribution

   Follow these instructions to build a Cygwin/X documentation source code
   distribution:
    1. Edit the version tag in the third line of the file configure.in to
       indicated a new version, or to add a branch name to the
       distribution. The line containing the version tag should look like:

AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(cygwin-x-doc, 1.0.0)

    2. Open a shell on your documentation build host; you should see a
       window like the following:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$

    3. Change the current directory to the documentation source code build
       directory:

Username@CygwinHost ~
$ cd cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$

    4. Build the documentation source code distribution:

Username@CygwinHost ~/cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0/build
$ make distcheck

    5. The documentation source code distribution should now be contained
       in the current directory in a file called
       cygwin-x-doc-1.0.0.tar.gz.
    6. Building the documentation is now complete.

Glossary

B

   Bitmap (Win32)
          Windows pixel map.

   Bitmap (X)
          X pixel map with bit depth equal to one. X pixel maps of bit
          depth not equal to one are called [85]pixmaps.

C

   Color Framebuffer Layer (CFB)
          Deprecated X Server layer providing implementations of the X
          graphics functions to draw on an antiquated framebuffer device.
          CFB is optimized to minimize CPU instructions at the expense of
          additional memory accesses; this does not work well on modern
          machines because memory access is the system performance bottle
          neck. CFB can only be initialized to draw on one depth of
          framebuffer per instantiation; this was done to eliminate CPU
          instructions that checked the current framebuffer depth, thus
          saving processing time on early machines.

   Colormap (cmap)
          X Server colormap. Contains a table translating index values to
          red, green, blue 3-tuples that will be displayed on the screen
          when a given index value is contained in a bitmap.

D

   Device Dependent X Layer (DDX)
          X Server layer that depends on the hardware; but not the
          operating system.

   Device Independent X Layer (DIX)
          X Server layer that does not depend on the hardware layer, nor
          the operating system.

F

   Framebuffer Layer (FB)
          X Server layer providing implementations of the X graphics
          functions to draw on a modern framebuffer device. FB is
          optimized to minimize memory accesses at the expense of
          additional CPU instructions; this works well on modern machines
          because memory access is the system performance bottle neck.

G

   Graphics Context (GC)
          X Server graphics context. Stores information describing a
          graphics operation to perform, such as the foreground and
          background colors, fill style, stipple, and tile.

   git (git)
          git is an open source distributed version control system. More
          information can be found at the [86]git project homepage.

M

   Machine Independent Layer (MI)
          X Server layer providing user input and graphics display
          functions that are independent of the machine used by the DDX
          layer. The MI drawing functions depend on only three DDX
          functions: FillSpans, GetSpans, and SetSpans.

O

   Offscreen Framebuffer
          Essentially a [87]bitmap, in the Windows sense, of size and
          color format that can be displayed on the screen. An offscreen
          framebuffer may be identical in size and color format to the
          [88]primary framebuffer, but this is not always required.

   OS Layer (OS)
          X Server layer that depends on the operating system; but not the
          hardware.

P

   Pixmap
          X pixel map with bit depth not equal to one. X pixel maps of bit
          depth one are called [89]bitmaps.

   Primary Framebuffer
          The block of memory, essentially a [90]bitmap, that describes
          what is currently being displayed on the screen. Any updates to
          the primary framebuffer will be displayed on the screen after
          the next screen refresh.

   Privates
          Additional information associated with internal X Server
          structures, such as [91]colormaps, [92]GCs, [93]pixmaps, or
          [94]screens.

S

   Screen
          X Server screen. A screen usually corresponds to a display
          device; however, Cygwin/X's X Server corresponds each screen to
          one Windows window. A single instance of the Cygwin/X X Server
          may have several screens.

   Shadow
          X Server shadow layer that allows [95]FB to draw to an offscreen
          framebuffer and occasionally call a [96]DDX function that
          transfers the updated regions to the screen.

X

   X Display Manager (XDM)
          An X Display Manager presents a graphical login screen to X
          users. Often an XDM will allow the user to select a desktop
          environment or window manager to be for their login session.
          Some X Display Managers are xdm, gdm (Gnome Display Manager),
          and kdm (KDE Display Manager).

   X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)
          XDMCP allows XDM to process logins for users remote to the
          machine that XDM is running on; login sessions will be run on
          the machine running XDM. For example, at a university you may
          use XDMCP to login to an X session running on an engineering
          department computer from your dorm room.

          See Also: [97]X Display Manager.

Appendix A. GNU Free Documentation License

   Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place,
     Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
     and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
     changing it is not allowed.
     __________________________________________________________________

0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
   effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
   License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
   their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
   made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
   of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
   designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     __________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
   terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual
   or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
   "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
   (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
   within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
   public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to
   text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
   whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
   modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not
   "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
   using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
   designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript,
   PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
   proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
   HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
   such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
   License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
   which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
   near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
   beginning of the body of the text.
     __________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
   conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     __________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
   Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
   on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
   you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
   full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
   You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
   changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
   the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
   copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
   them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
     __________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
   Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
   it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
       the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
       five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
       to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher
       of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
   Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
   arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes
   a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
   arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
   may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     __________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
   Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in
   the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History";
   likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
   sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled
   "Endorsements."
     __________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that
   is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of
   this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
   respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     __________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
   the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
   not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     __________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
   their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
   all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
   Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License
   provided that you also include the original English version of this
   License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the
   original English version of this License, the original English version
   will prevail.
     __________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
   as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to
   copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.
     __________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [98]http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     __________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
   notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
   LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.
