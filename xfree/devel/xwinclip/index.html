<h2>Cygwin/X - Development - xwinclip</h2>

<p>Last updated: 2004-02-22 1620 EST (Harold L Hunt II)</p>

<p>xwinclip is a clipboard manager for Cygwin/X that integrates
the X Window System clipboard with the Microsoft Windows clipboard.
xwinclip currently supports two-way text transfers.  More formats will
be added as they are requested by users.</p>


<h4>News</h4>
<ul>

<li>2004-02-22 - xwinclip is not needed anymore.  The integrated
clipboard support (XWin.exe -clipboard) no longer steals the X
selection and it works with most XDM servers.  This page is here for
historical purposes only and will be removed at some point in the near
future.</li>

<li>2003-10-30 - 1.2.0-1 has been released.  See the <a
href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for details.</li>

<li>2003-01-12 - Test08 has been released.  See the <a
href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for details.</li>

</ul>


<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>

<li>xwinclip may leak resources.</li>

<li>xwinclip may crash when it sees an unknown format.</li>

</ul>


<h4>To-Do List</h4>

<p>See the Cygwin/X <a href="../todo.html">To-Do List</a> for a
list of open tasks for xwinclip.</p>


<h4>Downloading and Installing an xwinclip Binary</h4>

<p>To update your installation, click on the "Install Cygwin now" link on
the http://cygwin.com/ web page.  This downloads setup.exe to your
system.  Once you've downloaded setup.exe, run it and select "XFree86"
and then click on the appropriate field until the above announced
version number appears if it is not displayed already.</p>


<h4>Using xwinclip</h4>

<p>To use xwinclip, modify your startxwin.bat file to start
xwinclip.exe.  On Windows NT/2000, add the "start /B xwinclip.exe"
immediately after the "start /B XWin.exe" line.  On Windows 95/98/Me,
add the line "start xwinclip.exe" immediately after the "start
XWin.exe" line.</p>
