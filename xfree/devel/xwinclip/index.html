    <h2>Cygwin/X - Development - xwinclip</h2>

    <p>Last updated: 2004-02-22 1620 EST (Harold L Hunt II)</p>

    <p>xwinclip is a clipboard manager for Cygwin/X that integrates
    the X Window System clipboard with the Microsoft Windows
    clipboard. xwinclip currently supports two-way text transfers.
    More formats will be added as they are requested by users.</p>

    <h4>News</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2004-02-22 - xwinclip is not needed anymore. The
        integrated clipboard support (XWin.exe -clipboard) no
        longer steals the X selection and it works with most XDM
        servers. This page is here for historical purposes only and
        will be removed at some point in the near future.</li>

        <li>2003-10-30 - 1.2.0-1 has been released. See the
        <a href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for details.</li>

        <li>2003-01-12 - Test08 has been released. See the
        <a href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Known Issues</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>xwinclip may leak resources.</li>

        <li>xwinclip may crash when it sees an unknown format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To-Do List</h4>

    <p>See the Cygwin/X <a href="../todo.html">To-Do List</a> for a
    list of open tasks for xwinclip.</p>

    <h4>Downloading and Installing an xwinclip Binary</h4>

    <p>To update your installation, click on the "Install Cygwin
    now" link on the http://cygwin.com/ web page. This downloads
    setup.exe to your system. Once you've downloaded setup.exe, run
    it and select "XFree86" and then click on the appropriate field
    until the above announced version number appears if it is not
    displayed already.</p>

    <h4>Using xwinclip</h4>

    <p>To use xwinclip, modify your startxwin.bat file to start
    xwinclip.exe. On Windows NT/2000, add the "start /B
    xwinclip.exe" immediately after the "start /B XWin.exe" line.
    On Windows 95/98/Me, add the line "start xwinclip.exe"
    immediately after the "start XWin.exe" line.</p>
