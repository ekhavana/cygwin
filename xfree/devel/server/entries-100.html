<ul>

<li>win.h, winmultiwindowwindow.c, winmultiwindowwndproc.c,
winscrinit.c, winwindow.h - Improve move, resize, minimize, maximize,
and restore operations on windows in multiwindow mode.  Reorganize
message/event flow, add new scheme to propagate window changes between
Windows and X layers, eliminate bunch of conditional branches and
cache variables.  A couple of bugs should be fixed.  (Takuma
Murakami)</li>

<li>winmouse.c - Properly clear the internal mouse button map when the
mouse device is closed.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwndproc.c, winprefs.c, winprefs.h, winwndproc.c -
Stop passing customized menus to DefWindowProc.  Although it does not
cause visible problems so far, it should be inhibited.  Apply a mask,
which is described in MSDN, for wParam in
winTopLevelWindowProc/WM_SYSCOMMAND handler.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winconfig.c, winconfig.h, winprocarg.c - Add some xkb settings
(rules, model, layout, variant, options) to the commandline options
and parse them even with configfile support turned off.  (Alexander
Gottwald)</li>

<li>xc/lib/font/fontfile/dirfile.c, encparse.c, fontfile.c - Some more
font path checks.  (David Dawes)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwm.c - Make MultiWindow Window Manager detectable
from other wm's as well as allowing it to detect other wm's.  (Takuma
Murakami)</li>

<li>xc/lib/font/fontfile/dirfile.c - Fix an exploitable buffer
overflow.  (Greg MacManus (iDEFENSE Labs))</li>

<li>xc/programs/Xserver/os/access.c - Prevent 0.0.0.0 addresses from
being sent to the other end of the wire when using Xdmcp.  Suggested
in the \devel at xfree86 dot org\ mailing list and discussed by many
people in that and other forums.  Should fix problems when using
unconfigured network interfaces and attempting to use '-query' to
Xdmcp into a remote machine; this was happening to a lot of users with
wireless and wired network cards in laptop computers of which one or
the other was usually configured but not both.</li>

winmultiwindowwm.c - Move calls to setlocale () from
winclipboardthread.c and winmultiwindowwm.c to InitOutput.c and only
call it on the first server generation.  Remove the g_fCalledSetLocale
global variable.  Make sure to call XInitThreads () before calling

SelectionRequest event is being aborted.  Make sure that

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c/winProcEstablishConnection - Change delay
in starting clipboard client from the 3rd call to the 4th call when
using Xdmcp.  Should fix the problem reported by Andrew Braverman; if
not, I'll have to make a much more robust system for starting the
clipboard client when using Xdmcp.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c/winProcSetSelectionOwner - Always advertise
CF_TEXT clipboard format, optionally advertise CF_UNICODETEXT format.
(Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_RENDERFORMAT - If
wParam is CF_UNICODETEXT, pass TRUE for Unicode support flag
(regardless of fUnicodeSupport value) when calling
winClipboardFlushXEvents.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD -
Add new handling for this message; we are supposed to process this
message for delayed rendering support.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>General Clipboard - Restructure the clipboard system to run a
single thread, regardless of the number of screens created in the
current process; the reason for this is that X selections are
per-display, not per-screen, thus there is no reason to have one
thread per screen for managing the clipboard integration.  Changing
from per-screen to one thread greatly simplified the clipboard
handling code and reduced the likelihood of errors due to interaction
between multiple clipboard client threads.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c/winProcSetSelectionOwner - Track whether
the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections are owned and if they are
transitioning from owned to not owned.  When one of PRIMARY or
CLIPBOARD is still owned the Win32 clipboard is not disowned; if both
PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD are not owned and a transition from one being
owned to being disowned is detected, then the Win32 clipboard is
disowned.  The user-level change is that you can select text in
certain X11 apps (which usually sets both the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD
selections), click elsewhere to unselect the text (frees ownership of
one of the selections but not the other) and still paste the text in
Win32.  The previous behavior would not allow you to paste the text in
Win32 if the selection was no longer highlighted.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD - We
cannot bail out when NULL == GetClipboardOwner() because some
applications deal with the clipboard in a manner that causes the
clipboard owner to be NULL when they are in fact taking ownership.
One example of this is the Win32 native compile of emacs.  Without
this fix, text could not be copied from the Win32 compile of emacs and
pasted within Cygwin/X.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Remember to delete the functions that were moved to
the new file called winprocarg.c.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<ul>

<li>General - If you use the diff above, note that the Imakefile was
missing from previous tarballs, so this diff includes the whole
Imakefile.  I have updated my source packaging script so that this
does not happen again.  Also, the source code in this release has
already been committed to the xorg repository on freedesktop.org's
CVS.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winauth.c - New File - Move winGenerateAuthorization into this new
file.  This function generates a cookie to be used by the clipboard
client for authorization when using Xdmcp.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winglobals.c - New File - Start moving global variables into this
file.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - New File - Move all clipboard wrappers of
ProcVector and InitialVector functions into this file.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>winprocarg.c - New File - Move winInitializeDefaultScreens and
ddxProcessArgument from InitOutput.c into this file.  The same will be
done eventually for other functions in InitOutput.c.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>win.h, General - Get started on removing "extern" declarations
from win.h by including explicit references to extern symbols in the
source files that use those symbols.  The long term goal is to start
breaking up the monolithic win.h header file.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>Xserver/dix/dispatch.c/Dispatch() - Add hook to OsVendorReset
function that can be optionally defined in the DDX layer when
DDXOSRESET is defined.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c/OsVendorReset() - New Function - Send a message to
the clipboard client telling it to shutdown, then wait for the
clipboard client thread to exit before proceeding.  This allows us to
cleanly shutdown the clipboard client.  Incidentally, I noticed that
the previous code would spawn *additional* clipboard client threads
when the X Server was reset; this was happening because we trapped IO
errors and attempted to reconnect when they happened.  There was no
code that told a clipboard client thread to exit when the server was
being reset so that it could be replaced by a new clipboard client
thread (which was happening correctly).  This should lead to greater
stabilility across X Server resets, though I did discover that this
version and previous versions where shutting down after two or three
resets without any error message being logged nor exception being
thrown.  That problem will be looked into later.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>winclipboardinit.c, winclipboardthread.c, winclipboardxevents.c,
winclipboardwndproc.c - Fix problems getting killed by Xdmcp code and
remote XDM/KDM/GDM client on startup.  Fix problems not being
authorized to connect when using Xdmcp by calling XSetAuthorization
and passing it our cookie that was created earlier; this removes the
need to save the cookie to a .Xauthority file.  Watch the CLIPBOARD
selection in addition to the PRIMARY selection and track which was
changed within X last so that we know which one we should paste within
Win32.  Fix crashes when the server resets (as explained above, it
still exits after one or two resets, for an unknown reason).  The
improved clipboard code should now be good to go.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwm.c - Clean up the startup of the two multi-window
threads.  Create separate error and IO error handlers for the XMsgProc
thread since it was using the same IO error handler as another thread
and would try to longjmp into the other thread if it received an IO
error, which was likely causing some crashes.  The multi-window code

<li>win.h/WIN_CLIPBOARD_AUTH_SUPPORT - Disable the new Xauth support
for the clipboard integration manager with a build-time flag.  Be sure
to delete ~/.Xauthority if you have one; X Client connections may be
prevented if you do not delete this file.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>InitInput.c/InitInput - Only wrap ProcVector[X_SetSelectionOwner]
when serverGeneration is 1, which prevents multiple wrapping of the
function when the server resets (the ProcVector table is not
re-initialized upon X Server reset).  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>InitInput.c/winProcSetSelectionOwner - Use ((DrawablePtr)
pWindow)->id instead of client->lastDrawableID for determining the ID
of the window that the selection is being owned by.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>InitInput.c/winProcSetSelectionOwner - Detect when pWindow is
None, in which case the selection is being unowned in X11; add code to
release ownership of the Win32 clipboard if we currently own it.
(Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>InitInput.c/winProcSetSelectionOwner - Abort if IsWindow fails for
the clipboard manager Win32 window handle; this may prevent problems
when the X Server resets.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD -
Don't call XSetSelectionOwner when GetClipboardOwner returns NULL,
since this means that the Win32 clipboard is unowned; there are many
reasons why the Win32 clipboard may be unowned, one of which is that
we release ownership of it when the X11 selection is unowned (see
above item).  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<ul>

<li>General - Everything up to the last three entries describes the
new clipboard handling system that does not steal ownership of the X11
selection each time that something is selected; this seems to work
fine, but it needs to be tested.  The last three entries describe my
nearly complete attempt at generating a MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, adding it
to the list of cookies that the X Server recognizes, and using it when
the clipboard client tries to connect during an XDMCP connection.
This authentication approach should work, but I need a break from
trying to figure out which of the function calls has a minor error in
its parameters; thus, it does not currently work.  However, feel free
to examine the source code and let me know if any of my calls to
GenerateAuthorization, AddResource, or XauWriteAuth are incorrect.  I
would really like to get this automatic authorization working as soon
as possible.  Until then I will mark this release (and all releases
based upon it) as 'test'.</li>

<li>InitInput.c - Add a function, winProcSetSelectionOwner, and wrap
the generic function ProcVector[X_SetSelectionOwner] with it.  This
allows us to get a notification each time the selection (clipboard)
owner changes.  Call SetClipboardData (foo, NULL) so that the
WM_RENDERFORMAT message will be posted when a Win32 app requests the
clipboard contents.  (Harold L Hunt II, Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>winclipboardxevents.c/winClipboardFlushXEvents/SelectionNotify -
No longer steal ownership of the selection each time it changes in
X11.  We can do this because we have notification when
SetSelectionOwner is called (see above).  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardxevents.c/winClipboardFlushXEvents/SelectionClear -
Remove handling, it is no longer needed; it used to request the
contents of the selection that we lost ownership of.  (Harold L Hunt
II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_CREATE,WM_DESTROY
- Add information to be used on each call to a window property.
(Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_CREATE,WM_DESTROY,WM_CHANGECBCHAIN,WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD
- Add ourselves to the clipboard viewer chain so that we receive
notification when the clipboard contents are changed by a Win32
application.  Our normal response to this is to call
XSetSelectionOwner, but we specifically do nothing if we currently own
the Win32 clipboard.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardwndproc.c/winClipboardWindowProc/WM_RENDERFORMAT,WM_RENDERALLFORMATS
- Request the contents of the X11 selection.  Use XPeekIfEvent to wait
until the response is added to our event queue (this could probably
lead to a dead-lock of a client exists before responding), then call
winClipboardFlushXEvents to handle the SelectionNotify event.  UTF8
and CompoundText targets require that we call XConvertSelection from
the SelectionNotify event, which will cause another SelectionNotify
event to be fired; be careful to check for this and do the
XPeekIfEvent/winClipboardFlushXEvents thing again if this is the
case (this is untested because I did not see any UTF8 or CompoundText
targets that needed conversion).  Copy the returned contents to the
Win32 clipboard with SetClipboardData ().  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winscrinit.c/winFinishScreenInitFB - Generate a
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 cookie and add it to the server's list of cookies.
(Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winclipboardthread.c/winClipboardSaveXauthData - Add the generated
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 cookie to the Xauthority file.  Beware that this is
hard-coded to 127.0.0.1:0 and that the entry is not cleaned up upon
exit; this will force the host-based access to be disabled in some
cases and could cause problems starting X Clients until this is fixed.
(Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>xc/programs/Xserver/Imakefile - Add $(OS) to the XWINLIBS just
after libXwin.a is included, which allows us to call unreferenced
functions in libXau.a, such as XauWriteAuth.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winkeybd.c/winIsFakeCtrl_L - Call Sleep (0) if the first call to
PeekMessage returns nothing.  TweakUI occasionally causes the Alt_R
press/release to not be in the message queue at the time that we
receive the fake Ctrl_L press/release.  Calling Sleep (0) gives up the
rest of our time slice to other apps that need it, which causes the
Alt_R message to show up on our queue.  We can then call PeekMessage
again and check if the Alt_R is there or not.  If it is not there,
then we assume that we have a real Ctrl_L press, if it is there, then
we discard the fake Ctrl_L as usual.  I tested this with the
US-International layout and it seemed to work fine.  I originally
coded this fix with a short "keytest" program and was able to confirm that
the fix works there as well.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

and send key press/release events to get that state in sync with the
Windows mode key states.  This removes the possibility that the

Add an engine-specific function that is called after a Windows-window
is created in -multiwindow mode.  This is a start for adding
DirectDraw support to -multiwindow mode.  However, I got a little
confused here and thought that one primary surface would need to be
created per window, which is not correct.  There will be one primary
surface with a clip list that causes blits to stay within the region
of all of our visible windows.  In any case, this is a step in the
right direction.  There code is currently disabled since the engine
setting code only allows the GDI engine when -multiwindow is being
used.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<ul>

<li>Merge NativeGDI development branch.  The NativeGDI engine is now
accessible via the "-engine 16" command-line parameter.  Note that the
byte order for 1-bit bitmaps is only configurable at compile time,
which causes the output to be totally messed up.  Although, you can at
least examine how the engine currently works.  (Alan Hourihane)</li>

<li>Display the argument to the -query option in the window title.
(Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>winprefslex.l - Remove use_unused_functions(), which was only used
to force two functions to be imported, thus eliminating a compiler
warning.  This is no longer needed with the newest test version of
flex.  (Earle F Philhower III)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Define HasExpat as YES.  This adds a dependency on
Cygwin's expat lib, but it removes the distribution of an out of date
version of expat that was included with the XFree86 source code.
(Gerrit P. Haase, Harold L Hunt II, Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>Fix the occasional repeating of keystrokes in the xkb layer.  This
problem has been present in XFree86 for years, but it was more
apparent on Cygwin/X.  This patch is not yet in the XFree86 CVS
tree, so any bugs caused by this patch will need to be reported to
XFree86.  See the following email for a description of how the patch
works <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/devel%40xfree86.org/msg03245.html">XFree86
patch email</a>.  (Ivan Pascal)</li>

<li>General - Add runtime detection for the Cygwin IPC Daemon.  This
allows SHM (shared memory) support when the IPC Daemon is running.
SHM support is automatically disabled, with no adverse effect, when
the IPC Daemon is not running.  There is now a dependency on the
cygipc package, but no additional installation steps are required,
unless you want SHM support; in which case you need to run ipc-daemon2
(See the cygipc documentation for more details).  (Ralf Habacker,
Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Ditch "-DNO_ALLOCA" and replace with
"-DINCLUDE_ALLOCA_H" for AllocateLocalDefines.  (Nicholas Wourms)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Ditch "-DUSE_XWCHAR_STRING -DUSE_XMBTOWC" and use
"-DHAS_WCHAR_H -DHAS_WCTYPE_H -DHAS_ISW_FUNCS -DNO_WIDEC_H" for
XawI18nDefines.  (Nicholas Wourms)</li>

<li>General - Recompile all libraries and executables for run-time
enabled shared memory support (SHM).  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>General - Recompile all libraries and executables for Cygwin
  1.5.3+.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>X11.tmpl, cygwin.rules - Fix some warnings about undefined symbols
during cross compilation.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>
