<ul>

<li>winkeybd.c/winIsFakeCtrl_L - Call Sleep (0) if the first call to
PeekMessage returns nothing.  TweakUI occasionally causes the Alt_R
press/release to not be in the message queue at the time that we
receive the fake Ctrl_L press/release.  Calling Sleep (0) gives up the
rest of our time slice to other apps that need it, which causes the
Alt_R message to show up on our queue.  We can then call PeekMessage
again and check if the Alt_R is there or not.  If it is not there,
then we assume that we have a real Ctrl_L press, if it is there, then
we discard the fake Ctrl_L as usual.  I tested this with the
US-International layout and it seemed to work fine.  I originally
coded this fix with a short "keytest" program and was able to confirm that
the fix works there as well.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>win.h, winkeybd.c, winkeybd.h, winwndproc.c - Remove dead code
that was wrapped with #if WIN_NEW_KEYBOARD_SUPPORT.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<ul>

<li>win.h, winkeybd.c, winmultiwindowwndproc.c, winwndproc.c - Remove
winStoreModeKeyStates () function and stop storing mode key state
within the hw/xwin layer.  Instead, query the internal X Server mode
key state, when we know that no key press/release events are pending,
and send key press/release events to get that state in sync with the
Windows mode key states.  This removes the possibility that the
hw/xwin and internal X Server mode key state vectors would get out of
sync.  This is also a general cleanup that utilizes more existing code
and removes some Cygwin-specific code.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winwndproc.c - Catch WM_ENDSESSION message and perform clean
shutdown.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winwndproc.c - WM_*KEYDOWN - Discard key presses generated from
Windows auto-repeat (these sorts of auto-repeats are handled by X).
(Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winmouse.c - Remap mouse buttons here when XFree86Server and
XINPUT are defined, since this combination of flags prevents a lower
layer from performing such remapping.  The end result is that
remapping mouse buttons works for the first time.  (Takuma
Murakami)</li>

<li>winconfig.c - Load the US keyboard layout for Japanese keyboards.
This ensures that WM_KEYUP messages are sent for the Caps Lock
key.  (Takuma Murakami, Kensuke Matsuzaki)</li>

<li>win.h, winengine.c, winmultiwindowwindow.c, winmultiwindowwm.c,
winpfbdd.c, winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c, winshadgdi.c, winwindow.h -
Add an engine-specific function that is called after a Windows-window
is created in -multiwindow mode.  This is a start for adding
DirectDraw support to -multiwindow mode.  However, I got a little
confused here and thought that one primary surface would need to be
created per window, which is not correct.  There will be one primary
surface with a clip list that causes blits to stay within the region
of all of our visible windows.  In any case, this is a step in the
right direction.  There code is currently disabled since the engine
setting code only allows the GDI engine when -multiwindow is being
used.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

or cutting large amounts of text now causes that text to be lost

multiple VK_CAPITAL key press messages, or if we are receiving one key
press message with a repeat count greater than 1.  If this doesn't
work then we may need to look at masking key press events for Lock
keys that are already pressed in X.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>Merge NativeGDI development branch.  The NativeGDI engine is now
accessible via the "-engine 16" command-line parameter.  Note that the
byte order for 1-bit bitmaps is only configurable at compile time,
which causes the output to be totally messed up.  Although, you can at
least examine how the engine currently works.  (Alan Hourihane)</li>

to force two functions to be imported, thus eliminating a compiler
warning.  This is no longer needed with the newest test version of
flex.  (Earle F Philhower III)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Define HasExpat as YES.  This adds a dependency on
Cygwin's expat lib, but it removes the distribution of an out of date
version of expat that was included with the XFree86 source code.
(Gerrit P. Haase, Harold L Hunt II, Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>Fix the occasional repeating of keystrokes in the xkb layer.  This
problem has been present in XFree86 for years, but it was more
apparent on Cygwin/X.  This patch is not yet in the XFree86 CVS
tree, so any bugs caused by this patch will need to be reported to
XFree86.  See the following email for a description of how the patch
works <a

patch email</a>.  (Ivan Pascal)</li>

<li>General - Add runtime detection for the Cygwin IPC Daemon.  This
allows SHM (shared memory) support when the IPC Daemon is running.
SHM support is automatically disabled, with no adverse effect, when
the IPC Daemon is not running.  There is now a dependency on the
cygipc package, but no additional installation steps are required,
unless you want SHM support; in which case you need to run ipc-daemon2
(See the cygipc documentation for more details).  (Ralf Habacker,
Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Ditch "-DNO_ALLOCA" and replace with
"-DINCLUDE_ALLOCA_H" for AllocateLocalDefines.  (Nicholas Wourms)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Ditch "-DUSE_XWCHAR_STRING -DUSE_XMBTOWC" and use
"-DHAS_WCHAR_H -DHAS_WCTYPE_H -DHAS_ISW_FUNCS -DNO_WIDEC_H" for
XawI18nDefines.  (Nicholas Wourms)</li>

enabled shared memory support (SHM).  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>General - Recompile all libraries and executables for Cygwin
  1.5.3+.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>
