<li>winclipboardwndproc.c, winclipboardwrappers.c,

calling OpenClipboard; if it is open and we own it, then call
CloseClipboard in hopes of fixing some reported deadlock situations.
(Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Add check for multiple instances of XWin trying to
run on the same display number.  Check for uniqueness among all
terminal services sessions.  (Takuma Murakami, Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<li>winvalargs.c - Validate command-line argument combinations; fail
when invalid combinations are found, such as "XWin -query foo_host
-multiwindow".  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winerror.c/winMessageBoxF - Add a function that works like printf
for Win32 message boxes.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winprocarg.c/winLogVersionInfo - Print version, vendor, and
mailing list email address in the log file.  (Harold L Hunt II -

<li>winprocarg.c/winLogCommandLine - Concatenate the command line into
a single string with line breaks at 60 characters.  Print the command
line in the log file and save it for winMessageBoxF to use during
FatalError and ddxUseMsg calls.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winerror.c - Make FatalError popup a message box telling the user
that a fatal error occurred, where the log file is, what version they
are running, what the command line used to start XWin was, etc.
(Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c/ddxUseMsg - Popup a message box telling the user that
the help information was save to the log file, tell them where the log
file is, what the command line used to start XWin was (in case they
don't realize they typed -help or an invalid parameter name), etc.
(Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>Xserver/os/utils.c, xdmcp.c - Replace several calls to ErrorF and
exit(1) with calls to FatalError; this allows us to present the user
with a popup message box, whereas the exit(1) call prevented us from
doing this.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c/ddxUseMsg - Document Alexander's new -xkb*

<li>winprefs* - Rename the WINMULTIWINDOWPREFS structure to WINPREFS,
since it is used even when MultiWindow mode is disabled.  (Harold L
Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowclass.c, winmultiwindowclass.h,
winmultiwindowicons.c - Identify these files for renaming since they
are not dependent upon MultiWindow mode being enabled.  Do not perform
the actual rename; instead, write this message in hopes that someone
else performs the rename in CVS in a manner that preserves
history.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>win.h, winclipboard.h, winwindow.h - Remove WIN_*_SUPPORT flags.
(Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>xc/config/cf/cygwin.cf - Remove the inclusion of xfree86.cf;
including xfree86.cf forced us to have several lines of code that
prevented drivers from being compiled, and forced us to define values
for certain #defines so that they would not be overridden.  Removing
xfree86.cf and restructuring the file led to a decrease in size of
about 30%.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>xc/config/cf/cygwin.cf - Add the build flags removed from win.h in
the form BuildXWinFoo.  Add defines for the various build options,
such as XWIN_FOO, which are added to the defines passed to the
compiler when building the server.  This allows us to remove the build
flags from the hw/xwin headers and it also allows us to refer to the
BuildXWin* flags in Xserver/Imakefile, which means that we should no
longer have to update that file by hand when enabling and disabling
certain features.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>General - The above changes required extensive rewriting of
cygwin.cf, which means that I may have accidentally broken or disabled
something that was working previously.  Please verify that things work
as they should.  Note that removing xfree86.cf causes 'xdpyinfo' to
report our vendor string as "The X.Org Group" and our vendor release
number as "6600"; this is different from the previous vendor of
XFree86 with version 4.3.0.1 or some such.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>
