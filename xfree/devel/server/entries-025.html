functionality is now handled by <a href="../xwinclip/">xwinclip</a>.
xwinclip will contain all clipboard support until the XWin.exe headers

the X Server headers.</li>

PseudoColor visuals with DirectDraw engines in windowed mode, as the
DirectDrawPalette object has the first ten and the last ten colors
reserved in windowed mode.  Thus, adding PseudoColor support for
windowed DirectDraw modes would be rather difficult.</li>

Unfortunately, the layer support doesn't work correctly when it is

<ul>

<li>Changed the PseudoColor whitePixel location from 255 to 1, which
allows Magic 7.1 to use the default colormap, as opposed to creating
its own.  This prevents colormap changes when moving into and out of
the Magic window, which keeps the window viewable when the focus
is in another X window. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Brought the experimental Native GDI support back from the dead by
setting up Pixmap privates and GC privates so that the global device
context handles could be gotten rid of.  Actually, the global handles
were long since gone, as the code that used them was #if 0'd out.  I
managed to change the drawing logic in the process, so the code now
only draws a white window, whereas before it was drawing the X hatched
background. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Rewrote the winFinishScreenInitNativeGDI () procedure so that it
defers most of the default setup work to miScreenInit (). (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Added winnativegdi.c, which includes functions to fit the Native
GDI support into the current engine framework. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<ul>

<li>PseudoColor support is now enabled, albeit with lots of
caveats. (Harold Hunt)

<ul>

<li>PseudoColor is only supported by the GDI blitter (-engine 1), so
you have to pass the '-engine 1' parameter to XWin.exe.</li>

<li>PseudoColor is only supported when Windows is running in 256 color
mode (8 bit color); the GDI engine cannot change the Windows display
depth, so you must be running Windows in 256 color mode before
starting XWin.exe.</li>

<li>There are plenty of situations that cause the colors displayed by
Cygwin/X to become garbled.</li>

<li>Release 35 has been tested only on Windows 2000.  There is no reason
why Release 35 should not run on the other versions of Windows, but I
would appreciate some quick feedback on whether Release 35 functions on
Windows 95, 98, Me, and NT 4.0 when running Windows in 256 color mode
and passing '-engine 1' to XWin.exe.</li>

<li>The StaticColor colormap only had 20 colors when using the GDI
engine.  Create the colormap with all 256 colors in the default GDI
palette, and set the shadow DIB palette to the default GDI palette so
that all colors in the colormap display correctly.  In other words,
fix the StaticColor support when using the GDI engine. (Harold

xc/config/cf/cygwin.cf that UseSmartScheduler has terrible performance
on Cygwin. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Add processing for the '-screen' command to handle 'WxH', if it is
present.  This is in addition to the new 'W H' format. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Grab a new ddraw.h header from the Wine project.  The new header
has several fixes to function parameter types, thus preventing
compilation warnings, and a few fixes to some structures that may have
been causing DirectDraw Surface creation problems. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Add a check for a NULL hardware device context being returned by
BeginPaint in the winBltExposedRegions functions. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Add error messages and extra sanity checks to winBltExposedRegions
functions. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<ul>

<li>A set of recent releases changed the '-screen n
WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH' parameter to '-screen n width height' and added
the '-depth color_bit_depth' parameter.  The '-depth color_bit_depth'
parameter is only used in fullscreen mode when using a DirectDraw
engine.  Some of that information was missing from previous change log
entries. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Tell X Server to quit when Alt-F4 key combination is
pressed. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Don't call IDirectDraw_SetDisplayMode if the desired mode is the
same as the current mode.  This makes fullscreen server startup and
switching back and forth between the server and Windows much
faster.  This also causes the current refresh rate to be used by
default in fullscreen mode, rather than the minimal refresh rate that
is chosen by DirectDraw when you change the display mode but do not
specify a refresh rate.  Translation: yay! (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Added '-refresh rate_in_Hz' command line parameter to specify a
refresh rate.  Specifying an invalid refresh rate will cause the X
Server to abort on startup. (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Switch from DirectDraw to DirectDraw2 to support changing the
refresh rate.  The minimum DirectDraw version required to date has
been DirectDraw3, which is not affected by this release; therefore, I
don't foresee anyone being forced to upgrade to a new version of
DirectDraw. (Harold Hunt)</li>

them side by side, then move the cursor between them; previously, the
mouse events from the second screen would cause mouse movement on the
first screen, not on the second screen.) (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>Improve cursor hiding/unhiding when using multiple screens
(e.g. 'XWin -screen 0 640x480 -screen 1 640x480').  Cursor
hiding/unhiding with multiple screens is not perfect yet, but using

okay for most people, as the primary purpose of 8 bit display mode
support is to ensure that new users have a good first impression of
running Cygwin/X; it is likely that most new users will
eventually move on to higher color modes. (Harold Hunt)</li>
