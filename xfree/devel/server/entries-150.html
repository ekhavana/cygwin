in multi-window mode since the "About..." entry is still above the
separator.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Enable the X-Resource extension, reported missing by
Nicholas Wourms.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<ul>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - Be careful to note that neither PRIMARY
nor CLIPBOARD is owned by the clipboard integration manager when text
is selected in X then unselected.  This fixes at least part of the
problem defined by Lev Bishop but needs to be tested.  (Harold L Hunt
II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowicons.c - Use BitsPerPixel() to calculate pixel
stride, handle non-packed modes.  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c, winclipboardthread.c - Properly destroy the
clipboard window.  Unfortunately, calling XCloseDisplay hangs for some
unknown reason, so we have to leave the display open; I suspect this
has something to do with our IOErrorHandler.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>XWin.rc - Move the About... entry in the tray icon menu up above
the separator and change the title of the About box to "About
Cygwin/X".  (Jack Tanner)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Try to do a better job of removing the tray icon.
It still doesn't seem to be perfect yet.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>
