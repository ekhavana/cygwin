<ul>

<li>winclipboardxevents.c/winClipboardFlushXEvents/SelectionRequest -
Change the 'format' value for the first call to XChangeProperty from 8
to 32 since we are passing a data array of Atoms, which are 32 bits
long.  (Lev Bishop)</li>

<li>windialogs.c - Check for hand cursor not present (pre-desktop
update W95/NT).  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwndproc.c - Don't set focus to windows with
overrideRedirect flag is set.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winlayer.c - Remove dead file.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>Imakefile, win.h, winrandr.c, winscrinit.c - Put in place a
framework for supporting RandR.  RRSetScreenConfig was added to
Xserver/randr/randr.c to allow setting the current resolution from
within the X Server (previously it was only something that X apps
could do).  There is a little bit of work to be done before this will
work, but it compiles fine now and LAYER has been removed since it is
no longer needed for RandR.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - Clear ownership flag of the other
monitored selection if an X application is taking ownership of a
selection, which might help to prevent clipboard related pauses.
(Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<ul>

<li>_usr_X11R6_lib_X11_system.XWinrc, win.h, windialogs.c, winprefs.h,

enabled by .XWinrc file.  Show the number of connected clients in the

the clipboard.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<ul>

<li>windialogs.c, XWin.rc - Convert "About..." hyperlink buttons to
show as hyperlinks.  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>wintrayicon.c - Don't remove the tray icon menu separator when not
in multi-window mode since the "About..." entry is still above the
separator.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>cygwin.cf - Enable the X-Resource extension, reported missing by
Nicholas Wourms.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<ul>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - Be careful to note that neither PRIMARY
nor CLIPBOARD is owned by the clipboard integration manager when text
is selected in X then unselected.  This fixes at least part of the
problem defined by Lev Bishop but needs to be tested.  (Harold L Hunt
II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowicons.c - Use BitsPerPixel() to calculate pixel
stride, handle non-packed modes.  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c, winclipboardthread.c - Properly destroy the
clipboard window.  Unfortunately, calling XCloseDisplay hangs for some
unknown reason, so we have to leave the display open; I suspect this
has something to do with our IOErrorHandler.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>XWin.rc - Move the About... entry in the tray icon menu up above
the separator and change the title of the About box to "About
Cygwin/X".  (Jack Tanner)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Try to do a better job of removing the tray icon.
It still doesn't seem to be perfect yet.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>
