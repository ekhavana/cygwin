<ul>

<li>winmultiwindowwindow.c, winmultiwindowwndproc.c,
winwin32rootless.c, winwin32rootlesswndproc.c - Fix MWExtWM resource
leak.  (Kensuke Matsuzaki)</li>

<li>XWin.man - Add missing documentation for command-line parameters.
(Rodrigo Medina)</li>

<li>XWin.man - Rework some parts of the document, remove outdated
information, update other outdated information.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>XWinrc.man - New man page for .XWinrc file.  (Rodrigo Medina)</li>

<li>winengine.c - The fix reportedly in 6.7-3 for ShadowGDI being
forced when not required was not actually in that release; include
that fix in this release.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winshadgdi.c/winActivateAppShadowGDI - Turn back on the manually
minimizing and restoring of our window when using the ShadowGDI engine
in fullscreen mode.  We perform the restoring or minimizing manually
for ShadowGDI in fullscreen modes so that this engine will perform
just like ShadowDD and ShadowDDNL in fullscreen mode; if we do not do
this then our fullscreen window will appear in the z-order when it is
deactivated and it can be uncovered by resizing or minimizing another
window that is on top of it, which is not how the DirectDraw engines
work.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Adjust link to FAQ.  (Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>winkeybd.c - Fix rare segfault caused by uninitialized event
queue.  Happened if FatalError Messagebox appeared because of missing
font "fixed".  (Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Fix segfault if LogInit fails.  (Alexander
Gottwald)</li>

<li>winmsg.c, winmsg.h - New function winDebug which logs messages
with verbosity level 3.  (Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<ul>

<li>winmultiwindowwindow.c - Reapply the path that fix multi-window
mode crashes when there were multiple instances of XWin.exe.  (Kensuke
Matsuzaki)</li>

<li>General - Enable build of Kensuke Matsuzaki's newer multi-window
mode that works with an external window manager (-mwextwm).  This
newer multi-window mode uses the miext/rootless extension and requires
Kensuke's <a
href="http://peppermint.jp/products/x/xwinwm-20040409-1454.tar.gz">xwinwm</a>
window manager, which will be released later as a Cygwin package.  If
you have to ask how to run this then you should wait until it is
explained better; please do not ask questions about this in the
mailing list for now.</li>

<li>MultiwindowExtWM Mode (-mwextwm) - Fix window reordering. Remove
winMWExtWMReorderWindows.  (Kensuke Matsuzaki)</li>

<li>General - Make most functions static that can be static.  Remove
declarations for functions used in only one place from win.h and put
them in that single file.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>wincreatewnd.c/winCreateBoundingWindowFullScreen - Stop using
WS_EX_TOPMOST for fullscreen windows.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winshadgdi.c/winActivateAppShadowGDI - Stop manually minimizing
and restoring our window when using the ShadowGDI engine in fullscreen
mode.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c - Document -logfile, -logverbose and -[no]keyhook
[Bug 437], and only document -xkb* parameter if XKB is defined.
(Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>winshaddd.c - Fix a few DDNL's that should be DD's.  (Harold L
Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winengine.c/winSetEngine - Oops, fix ShadowGDI being forced when
it doesn't need to be.  (Harold L Hunt II)</li>

<ul>

<li>winclipboardxevents.c/winClipboardFlushXEvents/SelectionRequest -
Change the number of elements passed to the first call to
XChangeProperty from 32 * 4 to 4 since we are the count of array
elements, not the byte count of the total array.  (Lev Bishop)</li>

<li>winerror.c/winMessageBoxF - Correct used argument for va_start.
(Alexander Gottwald)</li>

<li>winkeyhook.c, etc. - Add a low-level keyboard hook for catching
special key combinations like Alt+Tab and passing them to the X Server
instead of letting Windows handle them.  Add a "-keyhook" parameter to
enable this experimental feature.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers,
Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>windialogs.c - Display dialog boxes in the center of the Windows
desktop if Cygwin/X is minimized.  The problem was reported by Rodrigo
Medina.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<ul>

<li>winclipboardxevents.c/winClipboardFlushXEvents/SelectionRequest -
Change the 'format' value for the first call to XChangeProperty from 8
to 32 since we are passing a data array of Atoms, which are 32 bits
long.  (Lev Bishop)</li>

<li>windialogs.c - Check for hand cursor not present (pre-desktop
update W95/NT).  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwndproc.c - Don't set focus to windows with
overrideRedirect flag is set.  (Takuma Murakami)</li>

<li>winlayer.c - Remove dead file.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>Imakefile, win.h, winrandr.c, winscrinit.c - Put in place a
framework for supporting RandR.  RRSetScreenConfig was added to
Xserver/randr/randr.c to allow setting the current resolution from
within the X Server (previously it was only something that X apps
could do).  There is a little bit of work to be done before this will
work, but it compiles fine now and LAYER has been removed since it is
no longer needed for RandR.  (Harold L Hunt II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - Clear ownership flag of the other
monitored selection if an X application is taking ownership of a
selection, which might help to prevent clipboard related pauses.

<ul>

<li>winclipboardwrappers.c - Be careful to note that neither PRIMARY
nor CLIPBOARD is owned by the clipboard integration manager when text
is selected in X then unselected.  This fixes at least part of the
problem defined by Lev Bishop but needs to be tested.  (Harold L Hunt
II - CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowicons.c - Use BitsPerPixel() to calculate pixel
stride, handle non-packed modes.  (Earle F. Philhower III)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c, winclipboardthread.c - Properly destroy the
clipboard window.  Unfortunately, calling XCloseDisplay hangs for some
unknown reason, so we have to leave the display open; I suspect this
has something to do with our IOErrorHandler.  (Harold L Hunt II -
CodeWeavers)</li>

<li>XWin.rc - Move the About... entry in the tray icon menu up above
the separator and change the title of the About box to "About
Cygwin/X".  (Jack Tanner)</li>

It still doesn't seem to be perfect yet.  (Harold L Hunt II -
