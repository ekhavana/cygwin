<ul>

<li>xc/lib/xtrans/Xtransutil.c - Remove Cygwin-specific defines of
fchown and fchmod to chown and chmod, respectively.  It is not clear
when these were added, but they are certainly no longer needed and are
likely the cause of the first segfault that occurs if you debug
XWin.exe under gdb.  (Takashi Sawanaka)</li>

<li>Remove the condition variable used in the startup of the threaded
clipboard manager and multi-window window manager; the condition
variable was not needed and actually caused a race condition that
could prevent either manager from starting up.  Instead, just use a
mutex to hold the threads until the server has started, at which point
the mutex is unlocked.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winmultiwindowwm.c, winclipboardthread.c - Remove calls to
_Xsetlocale and replace them with calls to setlocale, since
_Xsetlocale is just defined to be setlocale.  (Kensuke Matsuzaki)</li>

<li>Fix a problem where the server window would shrink each time the
server was reset.  This problem only happened in non-rootless,
non-fullscreen, non-nodecoration, and non-scrollbars modes.  In other
words, it only happened when you ran the X Server in a single window
that had a window border but no scrollbars.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

so that the server can make a clean exit, instead of aborting
immediately by calling exit (1).  For later errors, call pthread_exit
(NULL) instead of exit (1) so that only the Multi-Window Window

<ul>

<li>General - Fix the broken build that was Release 62.  Release 62 crashed
during its startup sequence for anyone unfortunate to download it
before it was pulled from distribution.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>win.h, winmisc.c, winpfbdd.c, winshadgdi.c, winshaddd.c,
winshadddnl.c, winscrinit.c - Reimplement the stride pixel
calculations that were removed in Release 61.  The ``stride'' is the
number of whole pixels that fit in a padded scan line; in other words,
the stride is the number of bits in a scanline divided by the number
of bits used to store each pixel (i.e., bits per pixel).  We cannot
pass the simple pixel width of the window to the fb initialization
routines because sometimes we have invisible pixels on the scanline
that must be accounted for (e.g., when the number of pixels in the
width is odd).  Had anyone seen this bug they would have seen a server
that drew things diagonally (only -engine 2 seemed to exhibit this
problem).  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c - Add support for the `-clipupdates
num_boxes' parameter when using `-engine 2' or `-engine 4', in
addition to the previously supported `-engine 1'.  Once again, I can't
tell if this feature has any benefit whatsoever.  I need some
volunteers to perform rigorous testing with different values for the
threshold at which point updated boxes are collected into a clipping
region.  One may find the ``x11perf'' program beneficial here, as well
as ``glxgears'', which gives a frames per second reading.  Of course,
it would be most beneficial to have performance comparisons for a few
different machine types (processors, memory amounts, video cards, PCI
or AGP, etc.).  Update clipping is off by default.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>win.h, InitOutput.c, winengine.c, winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c,
winshadpfb.c - Change the DirectDraw module handle and function
pointers from screen privates to global variables.  Loading the
DirectDraw module and function pointers needs to be done only at
server initialization, not at screen initialization.  Similarly, we
don't need to unload and reload DirectDraw for each screen when the
server regenerates; rather, we need only unload DirectDraw when the
server is shutting down.  This cleanup makes it much for difficult to
misunderstand what is going on with the DirectDraw module handle and
function pointers.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>win.h, InitOutput.c, winengine.c - Detect the supported engines
only once at startup, rather than once per screen initialization.
Rework the supported engine detection logic to assume that the
DirectDraw module handle and function pointers have already been
loaded if they are present and working.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>win.h, InitOutput.c, winwndproc.c - Add a global module handle for
``comctl32.dll'' and ``_TrackMouseEvent''.  Try to get a pointer to
the _TrackMouseEvent function and print an informational message if we
cannot find the function, suggesting to the user that they install
Internet Explorer 3.0 or greater if they have not already done so.
We also set the _TrackMouseEvent function pointer to point to the no
operation function if we can't find a valid function so that any calls
to the function pointer will do nothing (instead of trying to
dereference a NULL and crashing).  Mouse pointer hiding/showing may be
messed up when we don't have _TrackMouseEvent, but the user can
remedy that by following the advice in the information message.
Remove our compile-time link to comctl32.dll.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c, winshadgdi.c, winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c - Add an
`-emulatepseudo' parameter that causes a depth 8 PseudoColor visual to
be created in TrueColor modes, with the same limitations described in
the Release 62 change log.  PseudoColor emulation is off by default.
(Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winscrinit.c - Add special handling for 8 bits per pixel screens
when calculating the depth of the screen.  An 8 bit per pixel screen
has no color masks so we can't sum up the bits in the color masks.
Fortunately, we know that an 8 bit per pixel screen is always depth
8.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

color information by counting the total number of bits that are set in
our color masks.  This should fix problems introduced in Release 61 for
users with 24bpp or 15bpp displays.  (Alan Hourihane, Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>InitOutput.c, winshadgdi.c, win.h - Add support for an
experimental parameter, that only works with `-engine 1', that
combines a specified number of boxes in the shadow update region into
a GDI clipping region then performs a single Blt operation for the
entire shadow framebuffer to the primary framebuffer, using the
clipping region to constrain the Blt to the updated area.  You specify
the number of boxes in a region that should be combined into a
clipping region using the new `-clipupdates num_boxes' parameter; by
defaul the feature is disabled, which is done by setting num_boxes to
zero.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winshadgdi.c, winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c - Add a call to
initialize an 8bpp PseudoColor visual on top of our TrueColor visual
when WIN_EMULATE_PSEUDO_SUPPORT is enabled; by default,
WIN_EMULATE_PSEUDO_SUPPORT is not enabled.  This new PseudoColor
visual will allow programs such as Magic 7.1 to display when
Cygwin/XFree86 is running with a TrueColor default visual; however,
the colors are all messed up.  It may be possible to fix the colors by
making changes to our local colormap handling funtions (and enabling
them in TrueColor mode, which they currently are not), or by making
some change to FB and/or SHADOW.  This feature is being added now
because Cygwin/XFree86 doesn't crash when we call
miSetVisualTypesAndMasks a second time; I must be doing something
differently now that fixed the crashing (probably the bpp and depth
handling fixes).  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winshadgdi.c, winshaddd.c, winshaddnl.c - Add a #if conditional to
winInitVisuals* that calls miSetVisualTypesAndMasks or
fbSetVisualTypesAndMasks depending on if XFree86Server is defined.
Currently this isn't useful because Mesa (similar to Open GL) doesn't
work when XFree86Server is undefined.  I'll leave this here for now
for future reference.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>General - Fix the KDE 3.0 alpha-channel icon bug that appeared
only when running Windows at 32 bits per pixel.  Many more details
below.  (Alan Hourihane)</li>

<li>
<p>General - pScreenInfo->dwDepth used to refer to the depth that the
user specified with the -depth parameter or the depth returned by
GetDeviceCaps (BITSPIXEL) and pScreenInfo->dwBPP used to refer to the
bits of color per pixel.  For example, running Windows at 32 bit color
would mean dwDepth == 32 and dwBPP == 24.  It turns out that this was
exactly backwards from what it should be.</p>

<p>The dwDepth variable new refers to the color ``depth'' of a pixel,
that is, the number of bits that make up the color specification for a
pixel.  For example, a 32 bit pixel uses 24 bits to represent color
plus an 8 bit pad for alignment purposes and a 16 bit pixel can use 15
or 16 bits to represent color.  The dwBPP variable now refers to the
bits used to store each pixel, that is, the number of bits that each
pixel occupies in the framebuffer memory.  For example, a 32 bit pixel
occupies 32 bits in the framebuffer memory while a 24 bit pixel
occupies 24 bits in the framebuffer memory (the former pixels are 32
bit aligned, while the latter pixels are called ``packed'' because the
pixels are not aligned and any given pixel may actually be stored in
two separate 32 bit units).</p>

<p>The meaning of dwDepth and dwBPP was corrected throughout the
source code, touching files such as wincmap.c, winscrinit.c,
InitOutput.c, winshadddnl.c, winshaddd.c, winshadgdi.c,
winnativegdi.c, winpfbdd.c, and win.h.  Also, we modify the depth 24
pixmap format at runtime to use 24 bits per pixel, instead of 32, when
Windows is running in 24 bit color; this matches the Windows pixel
format when running in 24 bit color.</p>

<p>The end result of all of this is that we now no longer report that
we have a depth 32 visual, as depth 32 visuals do not exist.  What we
were previously calling a depth 32 visual is actually a depth 24
visual with a different bits per pixel.  Advertising a proper visual
when running Windows at 32 bit color corrects the problem of KDE 3.0
not displaying icons or text with alpha channels.  Alan did the
magical part of discovering the underlying problem, I did the grunt
work of cleaning the code and making sure that all of the corner cases
were still handled.  (Alan Hourihane, Harold Hunt)</p>
</li>

<li>winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c, winshadgdi.c, win.h, winscrinit.c -
Remove the essentially unused dwStride and dwStrideBytes variables
from the ScreenInfoRec.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winshaddd.c, winshadddnl.c - In winBltExposedRegionsShadowDD* ()
we try to restore the primary DirectDraw surface up to
WIN_REGAIN_SURFACE_RETRIES (currently 1) times when a bit block
transfer of the exposed regions fails.  This corrects the case where
switching a notebook from its internal display to an external display
(or vice versa) would cause the Cygwin/XFree86 window to blank and
fail to redraw itself until the Cygwin/XFree86 window was minimized
and then restored.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<ul>

<li>Do a clean before rebuilding the server to ensure that the RENDER
extension is compiled in and enabled.  The RENDER extension is now
reenabled.  Unfortunately, the RENDER extension is the cause of the
display problem with KDE 3.0 icons that have alpha channels at a depth
of 32 bits per pixel.  It was previously thought that the LAYER and
RANDR extensions were causing the problem because a rebuild of the
server with RENDER enabled did not actually have RENDER enabled, thus
making it seem that RENDER was not causing the problem.  (Harold
Hunt)</li>

<li>wincreatwnd.c - Remove a seemingly erroneous return from
winCreateBoundingWindowFullScreen when we are using the Shadow GDI
engine.  This return was before we called UpdateWindow and
BringWindowToTop.  This seems to have snuck in at some point during
merging of my local 4.2.0 and main trees.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>win.h, xc/config/cf/cygwin.cf - Stop building RANDR and disable

3.0 icons with alpha channels to not display.  RENDER is still
enabled.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>xc/programs/Xserver/os/osinit.c - Don't close the stdin, stdout,
stderr file handles on Cygwin.  We are no longer a command-line
application so stdin, stdout, and stderr point to our first three file
handles, rather than to their usual locations.  This keeps the log
file from being closed when you run XWin.exe with 'start XWin.exe'.
(Stuart Adamson)</li>

<li>winwndproc.c - Call TrackMouseEvent to setup tracking for the
WM_MOUSELEAVE message.  When we see a WM_MOUSELEAVE message we show
the cursor if we are hiding it.  This will prevent cursors from

<li>winwndproc.c, win.h, winallpriv.c - Make the cursor state
variable, fCursor, a static local variable in

cursor is either hidden or shown, as Windows does not hide or show the

<li>InitOutput.c, win.h, wincreatewnd.c - Add a -nodecoration
parameter that creates the Cygwin/XFree86 window that is the same size
as the desktop, without a border.  The end effect is that you can
still get to the taskbar (even with Auto Hide enabled) and easily
switch to other application while not giving up any screen space to
the title bar, borders, etc.  (Jehan Bing)</li>

<li>winkeybd.c - Disregard the bogus key releases that we see when

the specified timeout parameter when using the 3 button mouse
emulation timeout parameter with a single X screen.  (Stuart
Adamson)</li>

<li>wincursor.c - See if we are the foreground window before warping
the Windows cursor position.  This fixes the new bug that occurs if
you launch Cygwin/XFree86 and give another application the focus.  In
that case the Windows mouse cursor would still jump to the center of
the screen, even though the Cygwin/XFree86 window was not active.
(Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winkeybd.h - Fix the bug where pressing both shift keys then
releasing them both would still cause all keyboard input to be
shift-modified.  The fix was to set the fixup for the non-extended
VK_SHIFT key to KEY_ShiftL.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>wincreatewnd.c - Pass SW_SHOWNORMAL instead of SW_HIDE to
ShowWindow when running a DirectDraw engine in fullscreen mode.  This
fixes the bug where launching Cygwin/XFree86 then giving another
application the focus before the Cygwin/XFree86 window was displayed
would cause Cygwin/XFree86 to never display a window or register a
window handle on the Windows taskbar.  (Harold Hunt)</li>

<li>winkeybd.c - winRestoreModeKeyStates () - This function is
supposed to handle the case where the user switches out of
Cygwin/XFree86, changes the state of a mode key (i.e. Num Lock), then
returns to Cygwin/XFree86.  Back in May I replaced a macro, WIN_XOR,
with the C binary operator ^.  At the time I didn't realize that I was
using the binary operator instead of the logical operator.  The end
result is that some of the mode keys were toggled each time that
Cygwin/XFree86 gained and lost focus, regardless of whether the key
state had changed.  The WIN_XOR macro is being used again, and I have
added a note as to why the C xor operator cannot be used.  This has
been broken for months, I'm really surprised that no one noticed it
yet.</li>
