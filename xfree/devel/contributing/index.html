<h3>Cygwin/XFree86 - Development - Contributing</h3>

<p>Last updated: 2001-07-02 0405 EDT</p>

<h4>How to Contribute</h4>

<p>Note, this page predates the Cygwin/XFree86 <a
href="../../docs/cg/">Contributor's Guide</a> that is currently in
draft format.  You will certainly want to start off by reading the
Cygwin/XFree86 <a href="../../docs/cg/">Contributor's Guide</a>, then
return here for additional documentation links and tips.</p>

<ol>

<li>Install Cygwin and Cygwin/XFree86; the <a
href="../../docs/ug/">Cygwin/XFree86 User's Guide</a> will be
helpful.</li>

<li>Get the latest XFree86 source tree from <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/cvs/">CVS</a>; I recommend using the
pserver method to get the tree with Cygwin.  My connection is capable
of 24 KBytes/second, but I get about 4 Bytes/second when I'm pulling
an XFree86 CVS tree; it usually take me between 12 and 24 hours to
pull a fresh tree.</li>

<li>You're going to need an editor that is capable of handling
UNIX-style end-of-line characters on a Windows machine; two good
candidates for this are <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html">NTemacs</a>
and <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs for Windows</a>.</li>

<li>Get <i>Definition of the Porting Layer for X v11 Sample
Server</i>, April 8, 1994, Digital Equipment Corporation, MIT X
Consortium, X Consortium.  There is a link to this document
below.</li>

<li>Consider purchasing <i>X Window System - The Complete Reference to
Xlib, X Protocol, ICCCM, and XLFD for X11R5</i>, 3rd Edition, 1992,
Butterworth-Heinemann and Digital Press, ISBN 1-55558-088-2.  This
book costs about $60; it has been replaced by a three book set costing
around $180; for most people the single book will be enough,
considering the price difference.  Note that these books are available
online, in PDF form, for free; the book is nice because it is much
smaller and tidier than any version that you could print
yourself.</li>

<li>Consider purchasing, if you don't already own it, <i>Programming
Windows</i>, 5th Edition, 1999, Charles Petzold, Microsoft Press, ISBN
1-57231-995-X.</li>

<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN Library Online</a> had
sufficient DirectDraw documentation for me to learn how to use it; in
hindsight, I could have saved some time with a more in-depth book on
DirectDraw, alas, I have no such book so I cannot recommend one
:(</li>

<!-- <li>Read <a
href="http://www.msu.edu/~huntharo/xwin/docs/xwindows/eXcursion2.pdf"
type="application/pdf">Design of eXcursion Version 2 for Windows,
Windows NT, and Windows 95</a>.  We are attempting to create a similar
server; the primary differences between our implementation and
eXcursion are that the identified shortcomings of the Windows GDI have
been addressed for us by DirectDraw.</li> -->

<li>Peruse the code in the XFree86 CVS tree under
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/</li>

<li>Pay attention to the mailing list and post your discoveries, if
they have not already been posted.</li>

<li>Enjoy!</li>

<p>1996 - Discusses some of the difficulties in creating an X Server
for Microsoft Windows.  More geared towards implementing a server that
translates X raster ops into Windows GDI raster ops.  Cygwin/XFree86
does not currently, as of 2001-06-06, translate raster ops, though the
framework to do so is in place, and development on raster op
translation will be resumed in the not so distant future.</p>

<h5>Online versions of documents that are in-print</h5>

<p>Online versions contain roughly the same information as the books,
but the online versions are free. :) Some of these documents have
graphics that appear out of place or grainy when viewing them on a
computer display; most of these graphics are fine when printed.</p>

rarely need to reference this book, but when I do reference this book
the information that I need is recent enough to answer my
