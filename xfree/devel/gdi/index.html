Cygwin/XFree86</a> GDI Development Framework
</h3>

<p>

<p>
The initial release of the development framework is now available.  Development framework release 1 includes buildable and runable source code that allows any interested developers to begin implementing the Device Dependent X (DDX) functions using Windows GDI functions; development framework release 2 will hopefully add support for DirectDraw graphics calls.  The development framework release is not a fully implemented and operational X Server; rather, as the name implies, the framework release contains place holders for most of the functions that we must implement to have a fully operational X Server.

<p>
Development efforts for the framework should concentrate on using Windows GDI function calls for graphics primitives (lines, arcs, polygons, etc.) and DirectDraw function calls for bit block transfers and bitmap operations; more information on which DDX functions nearly map to Windows GDI calls can be found in the document titled <i>Design of eXcursion Version 2 for Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95</i>; a link to said document is included near the end of this announcement.

<p>
Development framework releases produce XWin.exe only; xf_dx.dll is not needed by the development framework releases, as much effort has been put into allowing Win32 API calls directly from XWin.exe, rather than indirectly through a seperate DLL like xf_dx.dll.  Development framework releases do not currently support DirectDraw function calls; a ddraw.h header must be added to Cygwin to allow DirectDraw function calls.

<h4>
Installing Development Framework Release 1
</h4>
The development framework consists of several tarballs, including whole
	source files as well as patches to existing header files
	and Imakefiles.

<p>
Installing patch tarballs (install-dir-diffs.tar.bz2):
<ul>
<li>cd install-dir/
<li>bunzip2 install-dir-diffs.tar.bz2
<li>tar -xf install-dir-diffs.tar
<li>patch original-file original-file.diff
</ul>

<p>
Installing whole files (install-dir-src.tar.bz2):
<ul>
<li>cd install-dir/
<li>cd ..
<li>mv install-dir install-dir-backup
<li>mkdir install-dir
<li>cd install-dir/
<li>bunzip2 install-dir-src.tar.bz2
<li>tar -xf install-dir-src.tar
</ul>

<H4>
Building Development Framework Release 1
</H4>
If you already have a successful build enviroment for XWin.exe, you
	need only to rebuild your makefiles after unpacking the
	development framework files:
<ul>
<li>cd xc/programs/
<li>make Makefiles (takes between five and fifteen minutes)
</ul>

<p>
If you have never built XWin.exe you need to run the following commands
	to prepare your build environment:
<ul>
<li>cd xc/
<li>make World (takes several hours on my P3/550 w/256MB)
</ul>

<p>
XWin.exe is not built by default; enter the following commands to build XWin.exe:
<ul>
<li>cd xc/programs/Xserver/
<li>make XWin.exe (takes between one minute and five minutes)
</ul>

<p>
Expected behaviour of the compiled development framework release XWin.exe:
<ul>
<li>A Windows window is drawn
<li>The Window is filled with black lines
<li>Status messages are displayed on your console 
<li>Windows cursor disappears on startup, toggles as you pass in and out of
	the client area of the Cygwin/XFree86 window
<li>Execution may be *very* slow on Win9X machines as it is expensive to
	display status messages to the Win9X console; Win2000 does
	not appear to have this problem
</ul>

Thank you for your interest in the project,
