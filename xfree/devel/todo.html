<td>Windows display mode change while running</td>

<td>Catch and gracefully handle display mode changes while
Cygwin/XFree86 is running.  Some of this will require using
server-side RandR (resize and rotate extension) while other parts will
require catching window message and shuffling around device context
handles, reacquiring DirectDraw surfaces, etc.  Example case: assuming
a notebook computer that has an internal 1024x768 display and an
external 1280x1024 monitor; start Cygwin/XFree86 when the external
monitor is plugged in, thus the Windows desktop size will be 1280x1024
and the primary display is the external monitor; unplug the external
display so that the notebook reverts to its internal display; the
display area will have changed from 1280x1024 to 1024x768, and the
device context and/or DirectDraw surface handles may need to be
changed to point to the internal display.  Currently switching from
the monitor to the internal display will cause the Cygwin/XFree86
window to cease refreshing; the window will only be filled with white.
Switching from the internal display to the external monitor shows the
Cygwin/XFree86 window with the content stretched to fit the now larger
window.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Windows clipboard integration</td>

<td>Extend <a href="xwinclip/">xwinclip</a>, the Cygwin/XFree86
clipboard manager, to handle data types other than XA_STRING and
UTF8_STRING; for example, BITMAP, COMPOUND_TEXT, PIXMAP, etc.  Embed
the xwinclip functionality within XWin.exe.  The later task may be
rather difficult, as there are numerous collisions between the X
client headers and the X Server headers that must be prevented.  One
method of preventing collisions may be to break the win.h header into
multiple files, and to add a list of only the necessary includes to
the top each .c file.  Any embedded clipboard support will need a
command line option that can disable the built-in clipboard
manager.</td>

<td>Network transparent audio</td>

Porting</a> site for more information.</td>

<td>Cygwin/XFree86 needs the ability to play sounds from X clients or
windowing systems (Gnome, KDE, CDE, etc.) running on machines across
the network.  For example, you should hear, on your Cygwin/XFree86
machine, the sounds being played by KDE if you use XDMCP to logon to a
KDE session on a remote machine.  Investigate the various network
transparent audio systems, such as Gnome's <a
href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/dev.html">Esound</a> (appears to be
alive and well, contrary to the widely spread <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-devel-list/2000-July/msg00266.html">reports
of its impending death</a>), KDE's <a
href="http://www.arts-project.org/">aRts</a> (analog realtime
synthesizer), <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/levergood93audiofile.html">AudioFile</a>
(developed by Digital Equipment Coroporation in 1993 by Jim Gettys, et
al), and <a href="http://www.ncd.com/">Network Computing Devices,
Inc.'s</a> <a href="http://radscan.com/nas.html">Network Audio
System</a> described as ``the audio equivalent of an X Server''; NAS
is a very active project, with a recent release seen on 2001-10-06.
Linux's two primary sound driver systems may also be of interest: <a
href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> (Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture), and <a href="http://www.opensound.com/">OSS</a> (Open
Sound System).  There is a lot of material to process in order to
understand this task, however, the return from completing this task
would be highly beneficial.</td>

<td>Windowed mode window size</td>

<td>Currently we subtract one pixel off the bottom edge of a windowed X
Server if the window height is as tall as the screen; this is soley to
allow hidden Start bars to "pop up" when you bump the mouse against
them.  Needless to say, this is a horrible kludge, as it doesn't even
check to see if the Start bar is at that bottom of the screen (could
be on the left side, right side, or top of the screen).  Furthermore,
we don't handle any sort of window message that would tell us if the
Start bar has moved.  It may be that simply changing our window style
would allow the Start bar to pop up without having to adjust the
window dimensions.  Start off by looking at
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/winscrinit.c/winCreateBoundingWindowWindowed
().</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>Multiple monitors</td>

<td>Fix some oddities in window maximize, minimize, and restore
behaviour running the X Server on a multi-monitor system.  The project
really needs a developer with a multi-monitor system to look into
this.  Start off by looking at the activation message processing in
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/winwndproc.c/winWindowProc () and the
engine dependent procedures called in either winshaddd.c,
winshadddnl.c, or winshadgdi.c.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>Multiple X Server screens</td>

<td>Fix some oddities when running the X Server with multiple screen
parameters, such as 'XWin -screen 0 640 480 -screen 1 1024 768
-fullscreen'.  Notice, that will launch both a windowed X Server with
dimensions 640x480 and a fullscreen X Server with dimensions 1024x768,
as any parameters preceeding all -screen parameters are global to all
screens, while any parameter following a -screen parameter only
applies to that -screen parameter.  Start off by looking at mouse and
activation message processing in
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/winwndproc.c/winWindowProc () and the
engine dependent procedures called in either winshaddd.c,
winshadddnl.c, or winshadgdi.c.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>DirectDraw windowed PseudoColor</td>

<td>Figure out a satisfactory solution for enabling DirectDraw engines
to support PseudoColor visuals when running in 8 bit color modes.
DirectDraw reserves the first ten and the last ten colors in each
DirectDrawPalette object when running in windowed mode.  Therefore,
PseudoColor visuals are only supported with DirectDraw engines when
running in fullscreen 8 bit color modes.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>DirectDraw header files</td>

<td>We currently distribute xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/ddraw.h and
obj_base.h, which we got from the Wine project, in our CVS directory
but the headers should be merged with the Cygwin w32api headers.
Merging the headers into Cygwin's w32api package isn't as trivial as
it may seem, as the w32api headers duplicate some of the functionality
of the Wine headers; it seems that it would take several hours, if not
a few days, to sort out the differences and develop a workable
solution.</td>
