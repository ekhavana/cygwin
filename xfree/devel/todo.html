                <td>2004-03-04</td>

                <td>Coupled with the detection of in-use display
                numbers, it would be advantageous if we could
                optionally automatically assign an unused display
                number to a new instance of XWin.exe. We would need
                an IPC mechanism used for all instances of XWin.exe
                to share information about in-use display numbers,
                as well as a check of potentially available ports
                for use by other applications. Finally, this whole
                thing is useless if we do not have a way to query
                the started instance of XWin.exe for the display
                number that it assigned to itself; the ideal
                solution to this problem will likely require an
                external executable that has an IPC mechanism to
                retrieve the desired display number from all
                running instances of XWin.exe. We may be able to
                adapt the run.exe utility to query the XWin.exe
                instance with the same parent process id (should be
                the command shell that both were started from, I
                hope) and to then modify the environment being
                passed to a child process. There may be other ways
                to solve this problem, but anything that allows for
                a race between started instances of XWin.exe will
                be unacceptable, since an error would result in
                applications attaching to the wrong display.</td>

                <td>Display number <i>n</i> in X11 listens on TCP
                port 6000 + <i>n</i>. As of our X Server release
                4.3.0-49 we check for other instances of XWin.exe
                running on a given display number, but we perform
                no checks for other applications listening on port
                6000 + <i>n</i>. We may not be able to atomically
                check port 6000 + <i>n</i> and start listening on
                it if it is not in use, but we can at least perform
                a sanity check with only a small window where
                another application could start listening on that
                port before we started listening on it; this would
                be a sufficient fix for our purposes. Other
                developers can help with adding command-line
                parameters to control this feature once the above
                code is finished.</td>

                framebuffer to the updated Win32 window instead of
                blitting from a GDI shadow framebuffer. This should
                be trivially easy to start and should require only
                a single DirectDraw surface for the whole screen (I
                had previously said it would require one surface
                per Win32 window). It would be very important to
                just demonstrate that this can be done; clipping
                the blits to properly handle window z-order and
                such can be finished by other developers.</td>

                1024) to the X Server and all running applications.
                This should be very easy to do; you can use the
                code that is in place for detecting display changes
                and just pass these values to RandR to let it do
                its thing.</td>

                <td>Provide emulation of PseudoColor visuals
                (typically 8-bit palette-based visuals) on top of
                the default TrueColor visual (when running in 15,
                16, 24, or 32 bit color depths). This will allow a
                lot of CAD-type applications that require
                PseudoColor to be run when Windows is in a color
                mode higher than 8 bits per pixel. The general idea
                here is to add checks to any copying of data
                between offscreen and onscreen, as well as between
                areas on the screen; these checks test for
                differing visual types and convert the pixels and
                colors accordingly.</td>

                other than XA_STRING, COMPOUND_TEXT, and

                mechanism. The documentation source is available
                via CVS in the 'xoncygwin' project on sourceforge.
                This task is greatly simplied by the fact that
                Earle provided comments in his

                reserves the first ten and the last ten colors in
                each DirectDrawPalette object when running in
                windowed mode. Therefore, PseudoColor visuals are
