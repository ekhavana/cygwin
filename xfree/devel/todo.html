<p>Following is a list of open tasks on the Cygwin/XFree86
project:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="8">

<thead>
<tr>
<td><b>Summary</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
</thead>


<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Fatal server error: negative sized edge?</td>

<td>This error started occurring sometime after XFree86 4.0.3 was
released.  The message is generated by
xc/lib/font/Type1/regions.c/ChangeDirection (), which is not code that
the Cygwin/XFree86 project would have modified.  We do not currently
have, and we desperately need, a reproducible test case for this bug.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>xterm crash on exit</td>

<td>Figure out, and hopefully fix, the xterm infinite loop on exit
that has shown up on recent builds.  This may actually be due to a
regression in a statically linked Cygwin library, if xterm statically
links any Cygwin libraries.  Otherwise it is more likely to be a
change made to xterm sometime after 2001-06-01.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>Mutliple monitors</td>

<td>Fix some oddities in window maximize, minimize, and restore
behaviour running the X Server on a multi-monitor system.  The project
really needs a developer with a multi-monitor system to look into
this.  Start off by looking at the activation message processing in
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/winwndproc.c/winWindowProc () and the
engine dependent procedures called in either winshaddd.c,
winshadddnl.c, or winshadgdi.c.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>Multiple X Servers</td>

<td>Fix some oddities when running the X Server with multiple screen
parameters, such as 'XWin -screen 0 640 480 -screen 1 1024 768
-fullscreen'.  Notice, that will launch both a windowed X Server with
dimensions 640x480 and a fullscreen X Server with dimensions 1024x768,
as any parameters preceeding all -screen parameters are global to all
screens, while any parameter following a -screen parameter only
applies to that -screen parameter.  Start off by looking at mouse and
activation message processing in
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/winwndproc.c/winWindowProc () and the
engine dependent procedures called in either winshaddd.c,
winshadddnl.c, or winshadgdi.c.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>DirectDraw windowed PseudoColor</td>

<td>Figure out a satisfactory solution for enabling DirectDraw engines
to support PseudoColor visuals when running in 8 bit color modes.
DirectDraw reserves the first ten and the last ten colors in each
DirectDrawPalette object when running in windowed mode.  Therefore,
PseudoColor visuals are only supported with DirectDraw engines when
running in fullscreen 8 bit color modes.</td>
