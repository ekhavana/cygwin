<p>Following is a list of open tasks on the Cygwin/XFree86
project:</p>

<td>-rootless and -multiwindow checks</td>

<td>2003-09-22</td>

<td>The -rootless and -multiwindow flags are not supposed to be used
together.  Add simple checking to the -rootless processing to make
sure that -multiwindow is FALSE before continuing with -rootless
processing.  This will cause -multiwindow to overide -rootless.  Note
that we are not causing an error here, but it may be a good idea to
add a warning to the log file.</td>

<td>Window manager detection</td>

<td>2003-09-22</td>

<td>Search for a better mechanism to detect when another window
manager is already running so that the -multiwindow window manager can
abort initialization.  This should result in a failure message.  We
should also be using this mechanism to signal that our window manager
is running so that other window managers started after ours will fail
to initialize.  I saw some documentation on this, possibly in the
ICCCM, and tried to implement what they described, but it does not
appear to be working.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>MultiWindow DirectDraw and DirectDraw NL</td>

<td>2003-09-22</td>

<td>Try to create one DirectDrawSurface for a single top-level window
in MultiWindow mode.  Ignore window repositioning, etc. for now; just
make the surface paint correctly in MultiWindow mode.  MultiWindow
mode is currently slower than it has to be because it only uses the
ShadowGDI engine.  MultiWindow mode eventually needs to be abstracted
so that it can run on the ShadowDD and ShadowDDNL engines.  All I want
to see right now is a single surface being created for one
window... all the rest can come later.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>User's Guide - Document .XWinrc</td>

<td>2003-09-22</td>

<td>Documentation needs to be added to the User's Guide for Earle F
Philhower III's .XWinrc mechanism.  The documentation source is
available via CVS in the 'xoncygwin' project on sourceforge.  This
task is greatly simplied by the fact that Earle provided comments in
his <a
href="http://www.msu.edu/~huntharo/xwin/shadow/example.XWinrc">example
.XWinrc file</a>.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>DirectDraw windowed PseudoColor</td>

<td>2003-08-27</td>

<td>Figure out a satisfactory solution for enabling DirectDraw engines
to support PseudoColor visuals when running in 8 bit color modes.
DirectDraw reserves the first ten and the last ten colors in each
DirectDrawPalette object when running in windowed mode.  Therefore,
PseudoColor visuals are only supported with DirectDraw engines when
running in fullscreen 8 bit color modes.</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>DirectDraw header files</td>

<td>2003-08-27</td>

<td>We currently distribute xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/ddraw.h and
obj_base.h, which we got from the Wine project, in our CVS directory
but the headers should be merged with the Cygwin w32api headers.
Merging the headers into Cygwin's w32api package isn't as trivial as
it may seem, as the w32api headers duplicate some of the functionality
of the Wine headers; it seems that it would take several hours, if not
a few days, to sort out the differences and develop a workable
solution.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Windows clipboard integration</td>

<td>2003-08-27</td>

<td>Extend <a href="xwinclip/">xwinclip</a>, the Cygwin/XFree86
clipboard manager, to handle data types other than XA_STRING and
UTF8_STRING; for example, BITMAP, COMPOUND_TEXT, PIXMAP, etc.</td>
</tr>

<td>Network transparent audio</td>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Work has begun on this task.  See Kevin Kuphal's <a
href="http://www.sitecity.net/cygwin-audio/">Cygwin Network Audio
Porting</a> site for more information.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cygwin/XFree86 needs the ability to play sounds from X clients or
windowing systems (Gnome, KDE, CDE, etc.) running on machines across
the network.  For example, you should hear, on your Cygwin/XFree86
machine, the sounds being played by KDE if you use XDMCP to logon to a
KDE session on a remote machine.  Investigate the various network
transparent audio systems, such as Gnome's <a
href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/dev.html">Esound</a> (appears to be
alive and well, contrary to the widely spread <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-devel-list/2000-July/msg00266.html">reports
of its impending death</a>), KDE's <a
href="http://www.arts-project.org/">aRts</a> (analog realtime
synthesizer), <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/levergood93audiofile.html">AudioFile</a>
(developed by Digital Equipment Coroporation in 1993 by Jim Gettys, et
al), and <a href="http://www.ncd.com/">Network Computing Devices,
Inc.'s</a> <a href="http://radscan.com/nas.html">Network Audio
System</a> described as ``the audio equivalent of an X Server''; NAS
is a very active project, with a recent release seen on 2001-10-06.
Linux's two primary sound driver systems may also be of interest: <a
href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> (Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture), and <a href="http://www.opensound.com/">OSS</a> (Open
Sound System).  There is a lot of material to process in order to
understand this task, however, the return from completing this task
would be highly beneficial.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Windows display mode change while running</td>

<td>2003-08-27</td>

<td>Catch and gracefully handle display mode changes while
Cygwin/XFree86 is running.  Some of this will require using
server-side RandR (resize and rotate extension) while other parts will
require catching window message and shuffling around device context
handles, reacquiring DirectDraw surfaces, etc.  Example case: assuming
a notebook computer that has an internal 1024x768 display and an
external 1280x1024 monitor; start Cygwin/XFree86 when the external
monitor is plugged in, thus the Windows desktop size will be 1280x1024
and the primary display is the external monitor; unplug the external
display so that the notebook reverts to its internal display; the
display area will have changed from 1280x1024 to 1024x768, and the
device context and/or DirectDraw surface handles may need to be
changed to point to the internal display.  Currently switching from
the monitor to the internal display will cause the Cygwin/XFree86
window to cease refreshing; the window will only be filled with white.
Switching from the internal display to the external monitor shows the
Cygwin/XFree86 window with the content stretched to fit the now larger
window.</td>
