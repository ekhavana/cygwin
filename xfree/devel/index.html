<p>Current server development efforts are focused on a shadow
(xc/programs/Xserver/miext/shadow) framebuffer
(xc/programs/Xserver/fb) based server that uses three different
methods of getting the updated bits to the screen: the GDI blitter,
the DirectDraw blitter, and the DirectDraw4 blitter.</p>

<p>A side server development area is implementing each of the X
graphics calls using native Windows GDI graphics calls; this style of
server will not require a shadow framebuffer, nor will it require
access to the primary framebuffer.  The framework for the native GDI
server is contained in the sources for the shadow framebuffer series
of servers.</p>
