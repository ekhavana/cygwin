<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<ol>

<li>Install Cygwin and Cygwin/X using Cygwin's setup.exe.  The <a
href="../../docs/ug/">Cygwin/X User's Guide</a> may be helpful.</li>

<li>Get the latest X.org source tree from CVS, using the instructions
on the <a href="server/">XWin Server Development</a> page.</li>

<li>You're going to need an editor that is capable of handling
UNIX-style end-of-line characters on a Windows machine; two good
candidates for this are <a href="http://nedit.org/">nedit</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>.  Both <i>nedit</i> and
<i>emacs</i> are available via Cygwin's setup.exe.</li>

<li>Get <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~huntharo/xwin/docs/xwindows/ddx.pdf"
type="application/pdf">Definition of the Porting Layer for X v11 Sample
Server</a>, April 8, 1994, Digital Equipment Corporation, MIT X
Consortium, X Consortium.  There is a link to this document
below.</li>

<li>Consider purchasing <i>X Window System - The Complete Reference to
Xlib, X Protocol, ICCCM, and XLFD for X11R5</i>, 3rd Edition, 1992,
Butterworth-Heinemann and Digital Press, ISBN 1-55558-088-2.  A
version of this is available in <a
href="http://www.msu.edu/~huntharo/xwin/docs/xwindows/XWINSYS.pdf"
type="application/pdf">PDF form</a> for X11R4.  This book costs about
$60; it has been replaced by a three book set costing around $180; for
most people the single book will be enough, considering the price
difference.  Note that these books are available for free online in
PDF form; the book is nice because it is much smaller and cleaner than
any version that you could print yourself.</li>

<li>Consider purchasing, if you don't already own it, <i>Programming
Windows</i>, 5th Edition, 1999, Charles Petzold, Microsoft Press, ISBN
1-57231-995-X.</li>

<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">MSDN Library Online</a> had
sufficient DirectDraw documentation for me to learn how to use
it.</li>

<li><a
href="http://pdx.freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/?only_with_tag=CYGWIN&amp;cvsroot=xorg">View
the XWin Server code</a> in the X.org CVS tree under
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xwin/</li>

<li>Pay attention to the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/">cygwin-xfree mailing
list</a> and post your discoveries.</li>

<h5>Online documents not available in print</h5>

<p>The following documents are not generally available in print.  All
of these documents print out fine.  Be aware that there are several
versions of these documents, located on different servers, that do not
print out correctly.  For example, the first 20 or so pages will print
fine, but the last 500 pages will be gibberish.</p>

<p>1996 - Discusses some of the difficulties in creating an X Server

translates X raster ops into Windows GDI raster ops.  Cygwin/X
does not currently, as of 2001-06-06, translate raster ops, though the
framework to do so is in place, and development on raster op
translation will be resumed in the not so distant future.</p>

<h5>Online versions of documents that are in-print</h5>

<p>Online versions contain roughly the same information as the books,
but the online versions are free. :) Some of these documents have
graphics that appear out of place or grainy when viewing them on a
computer display; most of these graphics are fine when printed.</p>

updated, its scope has been broadened, and it has been split into
three parts, which are listed below.  For your information, I own this
book, as I cannot afford the three books listed below; I find that I
rarely need to reference this book, but when I do reference this book
the information that I need is recent enough to answer my
question.</p>
