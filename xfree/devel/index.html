<p>Current development efforts are focused on a shadow framebuffer based server that uses three different methods of getting the updated bits to the screen; the GDI blitter, the DirectDraw blitter, and the DirectDraw4 blitter are the three methods of getting the updated bits to the screen.</p>

<p>Future development efforts will be focused on implementing each of the X graphics calls using native Windows GDI graphics calls; this style of server will not require a shadow framebuffer, nor will it require access to the primary framebuffer.  The framework for the native GDI server is contained in the sources for the shadow framebuffer series of servers.</p>

<p><a href="shadow/">Server Test Series</a> - contains binaries,
sources, and change logs for the independently developed
Cygwin/XFree86 server executable, generally built from XFree86 CVS
with modifications.  Contributions to the Server Test Series are more
than welcome.</p>

<p><a href="docs/">Documentation</a> - contains compiled documents,
sources, and change logs for the independently developed
Cygwin/XFree86 documentation.  Contributions to the Cygwin/XFree86
Documentation are more than welcome.</p>

<p><a href="contributing/">Contributing</a> - contains some
information on how to start contributing to Cygwin/XFree86, and
descriptions of, and links to, helpful documentats and books.</p>
