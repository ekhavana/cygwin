<h2>Cygwin/X - Development</h2>

<p>Last updated: 2003-12-01 2330 EST</p>

<p>Cygwin/X is <a href="../docs/cg/prog-build-native.html">compiled</a>
using Cygwin's distribution of the GNU suite of development tools.
Microsoft Windows is the only commercial software required to compile
Cygwin/X; you do not need a commercial compiler, nor do you need the
Microsoft Platform SDK.  You will, however, find the online version of
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Developer Network
Library</a> useful.</p>

<p>Cygwin/X <a href="server/">source code</a> is very well commented
and the <a href="mailto:cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com">Cygwin/X mailing
list</a> members are ready to help you contribute to the project.
Visit the Cygwin/X <a href="server/">XWin Server development</a> home
for more information on obtaining source and contributing.</p>

<p><a href="changelogs.html">Change Logs</a> - Links to the change
logs for the Documentation, XWin Server, and xwinclip.

<p><a href="contributing/">Contributing</a> - contains information on
how to start contributing to Cygwin/X, and descriptions of, and

contribute a little money or hardware to make the current developers
more productive.</p>

<p><a href="server/">XWin Server</a> - sources, and change logs for
updates to the Cygwin/X server executable.  Contributions to the
Cygwin/X XWin Server are more than welcome.</p>

located, how to obtain that source code, etc.</p>

Cygwin/X and Microsoft Windows clipboards.  Contributions
