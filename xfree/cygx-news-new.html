<p>The <a
href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-xfree-faq.html#q-bash-extended-chars">FAQ
entry for displaying 8-bit characters in bash</a> (e.g., German
umlauts), has been updated.  In addition, the <a
href="http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-xfree-faq.html#q-mandrake-8.1-xdmcp">FAQ
entry for enabling XDMCP on remote machines</a> has been updated and a
table of known XDM config file locations has been added (in other
words, I switched to Debian and I want a reference to where the config
files are stored :).

<h5>Preliminary Integrated Clipboard Support</h5>

<p>The functionality of the standalone <em>xwinclip</em> program has
been integrated into the <em>XWin.exe</em> X Server executable.  This
functionality is off by default; it can be turned on with the
<em>-clipboard</em> command-line parameter.  Be sure NOT to run
<em>xwinclip</em at the same time as using the <em>-clipboard</em>
command-line parameter.
