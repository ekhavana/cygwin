<h5>Xt, Xaw shared libraries fixed - no more keyboard focus problems</h5>

<p>Fixes have been made to Xt and Xaw that fixup VendorShell stuff
using a DllMain function, which is based on the _Dll_InitTerm used by
OS/2 for fixing the same problem.  The changes to VendorShell fix the
problems with Xt and Xaw-based apps not getting the keyboard focus
unless the mouse cursor was over that application's window.
