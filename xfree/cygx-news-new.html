<h5>The Clipboard Related Freezes are Most Likely Fixed</h5>

<p>XFree86-xserv-4.3.0-61 includes an attempt to fix the Win32
application freezes being seen in some cases when pasting from X11 to
Win32.  Please try -61 if you have been having problems with
clipboard related freezes.

<h5>Cygwin/X Source Code Now Distributed via setup.exe</h5>

<p>Source code for Cygwin/X is now distributed via Cygwin's
setup.exe.  Source code for the version of Cygwin/X in distribution
was not previously widely available since our CVS tree has not had a
release made from it yet.  Cygwin/X building, packaging, and source
code packaging are now all performed via a script in the 'base' source
code package.

<h5>Multi-Window Mode Performance Improvement</h5>

<p>Takuma Murakami made a change to the multi-window mode in
XFree86-xserv-4.3.0-51 that resulted in a significant performance
increase.  For example, <em>xfig</em> used to require 7 seconds to
initialize and the screen flashed during this initialization; after
Takuma's changes <em>xfig</em> requires 2 seconds to initialize and
the screen no longer flashes.

<h5>XFree86-xserv-4.3.0-42 no longer steals selection ownership and
works with Xdmcp</h5>

<p>Alexander Gottwald and Harold L Hunt II devised a plan to prevent
the clipboard integration manager (invoked via the -clipboard
command-line parameter) from having to steal ownership of the X11
selection each time it is changed.  Harold implemented this and posted
it in version 4.3.0-42, which is available now via Cygwin's setup.exe.
A magic cookie is created when using Xdmcp so that the clipboard
client will be authorized to connect.  Additionally, XDM and Xdmcp are
prevented from killing the clipboard client when they go through their
initialization process.

<h5>CVS source code now hosted on freedesktop.org</h5>

<p>The Cygwin/X source code is now hosted on <a
href="http://freedesktop.org/Software/xorg">freedesktop.org</a>'s CVS
repository; our particular repository is administered in cooperation
with <a href="http://www.x.org">X.org</a>.  See our CVS page for
information on <a href="devel/server/">how to access the source code</a>.
