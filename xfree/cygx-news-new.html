<h5>Preferences system added for tray icon menu and custom icons</h5>

<p>Earle F. Philhower III added a system to allow the user to specify
arbitrary commands for the system tray menu (e.g. program launching
shortcuts) as well as custom icons for certain window classes.  This
is a huge system and is really amazing.  Preferences are stored in
~/.XWinrc or in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/system.XWinrc, which is formatted
as in this <a

.XWinrc file</a>.

<h5>Finally --- Shutdown Confirmation</h5>

<p>A system notification area (tray) icon has been added with an Exit
option in the right-click menu.  Choosing exit presents the user with
an Exit confirmation dialog box.  This dialog box has also been added
to shutdowns via Alt-F4 and Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.  Users have been
requesting this feature for years now.
