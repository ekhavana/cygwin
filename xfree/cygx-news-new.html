<a href="http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2012-June/001977.html">
X.Org X11 Release 7.7</a>
are now included in Cygwin.
Details are available in the announcements

Since X server 1.17, by default the server does not listen for TCP/IP
connections, only accepting local connections on a unix domain socket.
The <tt>-listen tcp</tt> option can be used to restore the previous behaviour.
See <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/docs/faq/cygwin-x-faq.html#q-remote-clients-cant-connect">
this FAQ</a> for more details.
