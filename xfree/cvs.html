<h1 align=center>Cygwin/XFree in CVS</h1>

<p>The sources to the core Cygwin/XFree files are available via anonymous CVS
from the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/cvs/">Xfree86 CVS </a>servers.  If you don't
know what CVS is, visit <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS">the
CVS home page</a> or read <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/cvs/cvs_toc.html">the CVS
Manual</a>.  You'll need a version with networking capabilities to
access this server.</p>

<p>Some notes that may help with getting and building the source via CVS from a
Windows PC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to have cygwin on your machine to compile the source. To install
    Cygwin, follow this <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">link</a> and
    use the setup button on that page.</li>
  <li> Windows users may need to make sure the
<tt>HOME</tt> environment variable is set to something meaningful. (for example
create a directory c:\users\home and do SET HOME=C:\users\home). (On Cygwin 1.1.4 and newer this should be automatically
    created when you first run Bash).&nbsp;<br>
    After this, you shouldn't have to worry about passwords any more,
as it will store your password in <tt>$HOME/.cvspass</tt>
(semi-encoded).  In other words, don't type "<tt>cvs login</tt>"
again.</li>
  <li>On the Xfree86.org CVS pages, follow the instructions for &quot;Accessing
    Anoncvs Via cvs pserver in an UNIX-like environment&quot; Cygwin provides a
    unix-like environment for windows PC's.</li>
</ul>
