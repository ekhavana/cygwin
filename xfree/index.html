<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 is a port of <a
href="http://xfree86.org">XFree86</a> to the Microsoft Windows family
of operating systems.  Cygwin/XFree86 runs on all recent consumer and
business versions of Windows; as of 2002-01-06 those versions are
specifically Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, and Windows XP.</p>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 consists of an X Server, Xlib, and nearly all of the
standard X clients, such as xterm, xhost, xdpyinfo, xclock, and xeyes.
Cygwin/XFree86, as the name implies, uses the <a
href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> project which provides a UNIX-like
API to Xlib and X clients, thereby minimizing the amount of porting
required.</p>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 is licensed under an X style license; Cygwin is
licensed under a modified GNU General Public License that specifically
allows libcygwin1.a to be linked to programs that are licensed under
an Open Source compliant license without such linking requiring that
those Open Source programs be licensed under the GNU General Public
License (see the <a href="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">Cygwin
licensing page</a> for more information).  Source code and binaries
for both projects are freely available.</p>

<h2>Downloading and Installing</h2>

<p>Obtaining and installing Cygwin/XFree86 is documented in a
step-by-step manner, with lots of pictures and examples, in the <a
href="docs/ug/">Cygwin/XFree86 User's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 binaries are distributed via the sources.redhat.com
mirror network.  You can choose from the current list of <a
href="mirrors.html">mirrors</a>, or visit our <a
href="ftp://mirrors.rcn.net/pub/sourceware/cygwin/xfree">primary
mirror</a> for <a
href="ftp://mirrors.rcn.net/pub/sourceware/cygwin/xfree/binaries/4.2.0">precompiled
binaries</a>.

<p>Cygwin has its own installer; you can click the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">Install Cygwin Now</a> link on the
Cygwin home page to being installation.  Install all Cygwin packages
and set your Default Text File Type to 'Unix' when prompted; only
deviate from these instructions if you are an expert.</p>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 source code is contained in the XFree86 CVS tree.
See the <a href="cvs.html">Source in CVS</a> page for more information
on obtaining the source code.  See the <a
href="docs/cg/prog-build-native.html">Cygwin/XFree86 Contributor's
Guide</a> for step-by-step instructions on how to build
Cygwin/XFree86.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 is <a
href="docs/cg/prog-build-native.html">compiled</a> using Cygwin's
distribution of the GNU suite of development tools.  Microsoft Windows
is the only commercial software required to compile Cygwin/XFree86;
you do not need a commercial compiler, nor do you need the Microsoft
Platform SDK.  You will, however, find the online version of the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Developer Network
Library</a> useful.</p>

<p>Cygwin/XFree86 <a href="cvs.html">source code</a> is very well
commented and the Cygwin-XFree86 mailing list members are ready to
help you contribute to the project.  Visit the Cygwin/XFree86 <a
href="devel/">development</a> home for more information on obtaining
source and contributing.</p>
