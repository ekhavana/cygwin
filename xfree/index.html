<H2>What is it?</H2>
<P>It was my personal idea, to port <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</A>, <B>the free and optimized X11R6</B> implementation to Windows 9x/NT.&nbsp; Later Chris Faylor, Manager Win32, Cygnus Solutions, provided resources by offering access to <A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree">Cygnus' Sourceware Server</A> and <A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/lists.html">cygwin-xfree</A> mailing list. Xfree86 source code and patches for Cygwin are available via FTP from <A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree">ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree</A>.</P>
<P>One aspect of this project to port XFree86 to Windows, using Cygwin B20.1. Few years ago, it would not have been feasible to compile XFree86 on Windows.  Cygwin B20.1 makes it possible.</P>
<P><A HREF="fortinj@ibm.net">John Fortin</A> later joined Cygwin-xfree porject.  He is working on porting <A HREF="http://www.ggi-project.org/">GGI (General Graphical Interface),</A> and DirectX.  He plans to use XGGI as a full-screen X-server.</P>
<P>&nbsp;XFree86 is not just yet another program, it is an entire window management environment, that usually runs in Unix environments. We are talking about 100MB of source code, much of which highly hardware dependent, e.g. the X Servers which access the video hardware of the PC directly. </P>
<H2>What is Cygwin-XFree?</H2>
<P>Cygwin-XFree is the nickname of Xfree86 to Cygwin porting project.</P>
<H2>What is the status?</H2>
<P>Following the approaches Holger Veit took for OS/2, XFree86 source code had been patched.  It compiles without problems using <A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin">Cygwin B20.1</A> and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/cygwin/gcc-2.95/">GCC-2.95</A>. Please read &quot;Resource Requirements&quot; for details.</P>
<B><P>The X-servers are not functional yet</B>.  We need to port <A HREF="http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86sup.html">Holger Veit’s XF86SUP.SYS driver for OS/2</A> to Windows.  XF86SUP.SYS driver provides access to I/O ports and mapping of video card’s physical memory to a user area, known as /dev/mem and /dev/iopl on some UNIX.  XFree86 servers need these features.</P>
<H2>List of archives</H2>

<UL>
<LI>By default, the URL points to the <!-- A HREF="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/xconfig/video-modes.html" Tuning video modes --> <A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree">Sourceware FTP server</A>.  It contains XFree86 source code patched for Cygwin B20.1 and precompiled libraries and clients.  Note: as mentioned above, X-server executable are not functional yet.</LI></UL>

<H2>How can I help?</H2>
<P>You can help by porting Holger Veit’s <A HREF="http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86sup.html">XF86SUP.SYS</A> driver (XFree86/OS2 support driver) to Windows.  It should be compiled using MSVC or MingW32 performance reasons. This driver is need to provide /dev/mmap and /dev/iopl features missing on Windows 9x/NT. </P>
<P>Since the patched source is available, you might consider recompiling the code yourself  (Consult Resource Requirements below) and fix bugs and improve certain parts. Before you start reinventing wheels that might turn out making the system incompatible, please contact me before doing so. I'll still be available as the mediator between XFree86/Cygwin and general XFree86. </P>
<P>If you are the first to help port XFree86 to Windows, you will be mentioned on the list! </P>
<H2>Which are the available information channels?</H2>
<P>There is a <A HREF="http://surceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/lists.html">mailing list for XFree86/Cygwin</A> porting project, with full text-search of the mailinglist archive. </P>
<H2>What are the resource requirements?</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Hardware: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>486, Pentium or PPro system with at least 16 MB main memory </LI>
<LI>To recompile from scratch, 300 MB free space on your hard disk. <B>The system requires a filesystems, for example FAT32 and NTFS, which support long filenames.</B> </LI></UL>

<LI>Software: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Windows 9x/NT 4.0. or Windows 2000.</LI>
<LI>Cygwin B20.1. (A latest <A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/snapshots/">Cygwin Development Snapshot</A> is preferred due to improved socket functions).</LI>
<LI>For network connectivity, you need Windows TCP/IP  installed</LI>
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/cygwin/gcc-2.95/">EGCS 1.1.2 or GCC 2.95</A> for Cygwin</LI>
<LI><A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/xfree/">libcrypt</A> to compile xdm security features.</LI>
<LI>You may also need <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Forum/6298/Patch_nt.zip">Patch.exe</A>.  When applying 3 to 6 MB patch file, patch.exe that comes with Cygwin did core dump. I ported GNU patch source code to Microsoft VC.</LI></UL>
