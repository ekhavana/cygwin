    <h2>Cygwin/X - Donations</h2>

    <p>Last updated: 2004-04-09 1415 EDT (Harold L Hunt II)</p>

    <h4>Reasons for Donations</h4>

    <p>There are a couple reasons why you may be at this page:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You appreciate the features that Cygwin/X already has
        and you want to show your appreciation for the effort that
        was put into developing those features.</li>

        <li>You want to take some of the monetary burden of
        ensuring that my development machines are up-to-date, thus
        making it a *lot* easier for me to devote time to Cygwin/X
        development.</li>

        <li>You are an individual or business user interested in
        the development of a particular feature that you would find
        beneficial, but that no one has spent much time working on
        to date. Such features typically require weeks or months to
        develop and monetary support surely makes it easier to
        finish these features in a more timely manner.</li>

        <li>You are business user contributing a fair amount of
        money for the potentially large benefit (and cost savings)
        that your company derives from Cygwin/X development. You
        feel that $200 is worth the benefit that your project or
        department is receiving from Cygwin/X.</li>

        <li>Or, you just have some money to burn :)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>How the Monetary Donations are Collected</h4>

    <p>I have setup a PayPal account (links below) that can accept
    payments from both PayPal members and from people without
    PayPal accounts. You can pay with a credit card (Visa,
    MasterCard, Discover/Novus, and American Express) regardless of
    whether or not you have a PayPal account. Additionally, PayPal
    members may transfer funds from their PayPal account to my
    account; direct transfers from a PayPal account have lower fees
    than credit card payments, however, credit card payments are
    really easy so the fee (~3%) is worth it.</p>

    <h4>Cygwin/X - Project-Level Monetary Donations</h4>

    <p>We can accept, as of 2002-10-01, monetary donations for past
    Cygwin/X development.</p>
