<h2>Cygwin/XFree86 - Donations</h2>

<p>Last updated: 2002-10-01 2145 EDT</p>


<h4>Reasons for Donations</h4>

<p>There are a couple reasons why you may be at this page:</p>

<ol>

<li>You appreciate the features that Cygwin/XFree86 already has and
you want to show your appreciation for the effort that was put into
developing those features.</li>

<li>You want to take some of the monetary burden of ensuring that my
development machines are up-to-date, thus making it a *lot* easier for
us to devote time to Cygwin/XFree86 development.</li>

<li>You are an individual or business user interested in the
development of a particular feature that you would find beneficial,
but that no one has spent much time working on to date.  Such features
typically require weeks or months to develop and monetary support
surely makes it easier to finish these features in a more timely manner.</li>

<li>You are business user contributing a fair amount of money for the
potentially large benefit (and cost savings) that your company derives
from Cygwin/XFree86 development.  You know that $500 means nothing to
your project's or department's budget, but it means a complete
overhaul of one of our Cygwin/XFree86 development machines.</li>

<li>Or, you just have some money to burn :)</li>

</ol>


<h4>How the Monetary Donations are Collected</h4>

<p>I have setup a PayPal account (links below) that can accept
payments from both PayPal members and from people without PayPal
accounts.  You can pay with a credit card (Visa, MasterCard,
Discover/Novus, and American Express) regardless of whether or not you
have a PayPal account.  Additionally, PayPal members may transfer
funds from their PayPal account to my account; direct transfers from a
PayPal account have lower fees than credit card payments, however,
credit card payments are really easy so the fee (~3%) is worth it.</p>


<h4>Cygwin/XFree86 - Project-Level Monetary Donations</h4>

<p>We can accept, as of 2002-10-01, monetary donations for past
Cygwin/XFree86 development.  We will be putting up a chart later on
with bids for the development of various features that many people
would like but that require too much time for us to develop without
some support.  If you are interested in having a bid for a particular
feature, feel free to email cygwin-xfree@cygwin.com with a description
of the feature and we will put up a bid for you to look at.  (Note:
This does not say that Cygwin/XFree86 development will only occur when
there is money donated; rather, this is saying that some features are
so large that the chances are pretty slim of having them finished in a
timely fashion without monetary support.)</p>
