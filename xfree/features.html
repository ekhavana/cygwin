    <h2>Cygwin/X - Features</h2>

    <p>Last updated: 2003-12-24 1735 EST (Harold L Hunt II)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Cost - Cygwin/X is free for use and the source code
            is freely available for modification.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Support - Free support is available in the Cygwin/X
            mailing list. The people answering questions are
            usually the same people that wrote the software, so
            they can often fix a problem if one is discovered.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Modifiability - Cygwin/X can be modified in-house by
            your own programmers, you can request features on the
            mailing list and see if someone is interested in doing
            it for you, or you can approach members of the Cygwin/X
            community to see if they will develop your feature in a
            timely manner for a fee (such an arrangement should be
            setup outside of the Cygwin/X project and the terms of
            such an arrangment would only be applicable to the
            third party requesting the feature and the developer(s)
            signing the contract).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Windows Versions - Supports Windows 95, Windows 98,
            Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP,
            and Windows Server 2003.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Color Depths - Supports all Windows 95 and later
            supported color depths.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>PseduoColor - 8 bit PseudoColor (palletized color)
            support in Full Screen mode (-fullscreen) and when
            running Windows in an 8 bit color depth.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Logins - Remote logins to XDM (X Display
            Manager) services are supported, allowing the entire
            session to be managed by a remote machine. Coupled with
            Full Screen mode, Cygwin/X can be used as an
            alternative to a KVM switch for *nix machines on your
            local network.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Clients - Remote clients can be launched and
            displayed in your Cygwin/X session either via telnet or
            via X11 tunneling over ssh, using either Cygwin's
            openssh package, PuTTY, or any other ssh client.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>DirectDraw Acceleration - Every mode except for the
            current Multi-Window mode supports acceleration via
            DirectDraw.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>OpenGL Graphics - The
            <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa 3D Graphics
            Library</a> provides software-based OpenGL support.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Access - You can use Cygwin's openssh package
            and its sshd daemon to allow X11 tunneling of
            applications from your Windows machine to other
            machines on your network. For example, you can launch
            emacs on your Windows machine and use it to view and
            edit files remotely from any other machine with an X
            Server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Multi-Window Mode - Multi-Window mode allows each X
            Client to be opened in, and managed by, its own Windows
            window. This makes each X Client show up independently
            in the task bar. Additionally, the icon hint provided
            by the X Client is used for the Windows window
            icon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Rootless Mode - Rootless mode makes the root window
            for the X Server be transparent, making all of the X
            Clients float over the other Windows windows. Rootless
            mode requires an external window manager, such as twm,
            openbox, fvwm2, WindowMaker, etc.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Fullscreen Mode - Fullscreen mode allows the entire
            display to be taken over by Cygwin/X, which works
            particularly well when logging into a remote XDM
            server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No Decoration Mode - No Decoration mode creates a
            full-sized root window (not to be used with Fullscreen,
            Multi-Window, or Rootless modes) without any Windows
            window decorations (title bar, border, etc.).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Clipboard Integration - Clipboard integration
            between the X clipboard and the Windows clipboard.
            Supports text only. Works with Unicode and MBCS strings
            for non-U.S. locales.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Non-U.S. Keyboard Layouts - Many non-U.S. keyboard
            layouts are detected automatically, causing the
            appropriate keyboard map to be loaded. Keyboard layouts
            that are not automatically detected can be added to the
            list of automatically supported layouts easily upon
            request. XF86Config file support is also provided to
            allow manually specifying a keyboard layout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>AltGr Support - Cygwin/X properly handles the AltGr
            key used in many non-U.S. keyboard layouts and passes
            this key on to each particular X Client for further
            processing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Start Menu Icons - Windows Start Menu icons are
            provided to launch installed X Clients (such as xterm,
            xeyes, emacs, etc.).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Tray Icon - A tray icon is provided to indicate that
            the server is running, to allow easy access to the Exit
            command, and to toggle visibility of the root window in
            Rootless mode.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Configurable Tray Icon Menu - Menu entries can be
            added to the configurable tray icon menu via a .XWinrc
            file in the user's home directory, or via a
            system.XWinrc file in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11.</p>
        </li>
