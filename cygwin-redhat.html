<h1 align=center>So do I have to buy it or what?</h1>

<p>The Cygwin DLL is offered under the same license as many other
free software packages -- it uses the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL).</p>

<p>This means that if your program uses the Cygwin DLL, you
<em>must</em> also <a href="http://cygwin.com/license.html">provide
source code for your program</a>.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to the above free software method of using
the Cygwin DLL.  Red Hat also provides a "commercial use" license which
allows you to distribute only binary copies of your program and the
Cygwin DLL.  This method requires the purchase of a <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">license from Red
Hat</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the license that is appropriate for you is entirely based
on your requirements.  If you cannot distribute source code, then you
need the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">comercial
license</a>.  If you are able to distribute source code, then the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/license.html">free software license</a> is
probably appropriate.</p>

<p>The above information provides links to information about both
licensing methods.  If you are interested in purchasing a commercial
license, then you will eventually need to communicate with a Red Hat
employee.  Please be advised however, that the person you will be
communicating with will be a <em>sales person</em>.  They will not be a
lawyer.  They will be able to provide you with information on purchasing
a commercial license.  They will be able to help you decide if you need
a commercial license.  They <b>will not</b> be able to help you to
figure out if you are correctly adhering to the GPL.  If you have
concerns about your distribution of your source code please contact your
lawyer.  Unfortunately, we can't offer free legal advice.</p>
