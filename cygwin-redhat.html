<h1 align=center>So do I have to buy it or what?</h1>

<p>The Cygwin DLL is offered under the same license as many other
free software packages -- it uses the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>

<p>This means that if your program uses the Cygwin DLL, you
<em>must</em> also be prepared to <a href="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">
provide source code for your program</a>.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to the above free software employment of
the Cygwin DLL.  Red Hat also provides a "commercial use" license which
allows you to distribute only binary copies of your program and the
Cygwin DLL.  This method requires the purchase of a <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">license from Red
Hat</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the license that is appropriate for you is entirely based
on your requirements.  If you cannot distribute source code, then you
need the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/">comercial
license</a>.  If you are able to distribute source code, then the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">free software license</a> is
probably appropriate.</p>

<p>The above information provides links to information about both
licensing methods.  The purchase of a commercial license will eventually
require communication with a Red Hat sales associate.</p>

<p>This person will be able to provide you with information on purchasing
a commercial license.  They will also be able to help you decide if you need
a commercial license.</p>

<p>The sales person <b>will not</b> be able to help you to figure out if
you are correctly adhering to the GPL.  They are not able to provide
advice on the best way to package your installation for adherence to the
GPL.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about your distribution and are unsure what
needs to be done to adhere to the GPL, you should engage the services of
a lawyer.  If this is not feasible then you may certainly try emailing
the <a href="http://cygwin.com/lists.html"> cygwin mailing list</a>.
Any advice you receive there will, of course, be unofficial and
non-binding.</p>

<p>To reiterate: the sales person will not be able to help you to figure
out if you are correctly adhering to the GPL. We would appreciate it if
you would not contact them for help in this area.</p>

<br>
<p>Whichever license you choose, thank you for using Cygwin!</p>
