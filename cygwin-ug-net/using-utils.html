>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cygcheck</B

that examines your system and reports the information that is
significant to the proper operation of Cygwin programs.  It can give
information about a specific program (or program) you are trying to
run, general system information, or both.  If you list one or more
programs on the command line, it will diagnose the runtime environment
of that program or programs.  If you specify the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-s</TT
>
option, it will give general system information.  If you specify
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-s</TT
> and list one or more programs on the command line,
it reports on both.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cygcheck</B
> program should be used to send
information about your system to Cygnus for troubleshooting (if your
support representative requests it).  When asked to run this command,
include all the options plus any commands you are having trouble with,
and save the output so that you can mail it to Cygnus, like
this:</P

><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-v</TT
> option causes the output to be more
verbose.  What this means is that additional information will be
reported which is usually not interesting, such as the internal
version numbers of DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL
usage, and if a file in one directory in the PATH also occurs in other
directories on the PATH.  </P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-r</TT

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cygcheck</B
> to search your registry for information
that is relevent to Cygnus programs.  These registry entries are the
ones that have "Cygnus" in the name.  If you are paranoid about
privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep
in mind that doing so makes it harder for Cygnus to diagnose your
problems.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-h</TT
> option prints additional helpful
messages in the report, at the beginning of each section.  It also
adds table column headings.  While this is useful information, it also
adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report
or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out.</P

converts Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and
back.  It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file name
to a native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a
native Windows program.  You may use the long or short option names
interchangeably, even though only the short ones are described
here.</P

one of these.  To give neither or both is an error.</P
><P

CLASS="LITERAL"

a path-style string rather than a single filename.  For example, the
PATH environment variable is semicolon-delimited in Windows, but
