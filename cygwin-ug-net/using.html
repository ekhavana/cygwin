>Cygwin supports both Win32- and POSIX-style paths, where
directory delimiters may be either forward or back slashes.  UNC
pathnames (starting with two slashes and a network name) are also
supported.</P
><P
>POSIX operating systems (such as Linux) do not have the concept
of drive letters.  Instead, all absolute paths begin with a
slash (instead of a drive letter such as "c:") and all file systems
appear as subdirectories (for example, you might buy a new disk and
make it be the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/disk2</TT
> directory).</P
><P
>Because many programs written to run on UNIX systems assume
the existance of a single unified POSIX file system structure, Cygwin
maintains a special internal POSIX view of the Win32 file system
that allows these programs to successfully run under Windows.  Cygwin
uses this mapping to translate between Win32 and POSIX paths as
necessary.</P

NAME="MOUNT-TABLE"
>The Cygwin Mount Table</A
></H2
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> utility program is used to
to map Win32 drives and network shares into Cygwin's internal POSIX
directory tree.  This is a similar concept to the typical UNIX mount
program.  For those people coming from a Windows background, the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> utility is very similar to the old DOS
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>join</B
>, in that it makes your drive letters appear as
subdirectories somewhere else.</P
><P
>The mapping is stored in the current user's Cygwin
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>mount table</I
> in the Windows registry so that the
information will be retrieved next time the user logs in.  Because it
is sometimes desirable to have system-wide as well as user-specific
mounts, there is also a system-wide mount table that all Cygwin users
inherit.  The system-wide table may only be modified by a user with
the appropriate priviledges (Administrator priviledges in Windows
NT).</P
><P
>The current user's table is located under
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Red Hat, Inc./Cygwin/mounts
v&#60;version&#62;"
where &#60;version&#62; is the latest registry version associated with
the Cygwin library (this version is not the same as the release
number).  The system-wide table is located under the same subkeys
under HKEY_LOCAL_SYSTEM.</P
><P
>By default, the POSIX root <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> points to the
system partition but it can be relocated to any directory in the
Windows file system using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> command.
Whenever Cygwin generates a POSIX path from a Win32 one, it uses the
longest matching prefix in the mount table.  Thus, if
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>C:</TT
> is mounted as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/c</TT
> and also
as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
>, then Cygwin would translate
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>C:/foo/bar</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/c/foo/bar</TT
>.</P
><P
>Invoking <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> without any arguments displays
Cygwin's current set of mount points.
In the following example, the C
drive is the POSIX root and D drive is mapped to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/d</TT
>.  Note that in this case, the root mount is a
system-wide mount point that is visible to all users running Cygwin
programs, whereas the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/d</TT
> mount is only visible
to the current user.</P

information on how to use these utilities to set up your Cygwin POSIX
file system.</P
><P
>Whenever Cygwin cannot use any of the existing mounts to convert
from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will
automatically default to an imaginary mount point under the default POSIX
path <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/cygdrive</TT
>.  For example, if Cygwin accesses
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Z:\foo</TT
> and the Z drive is not currently in the
mount table, then <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Z:\</TT
> would be automatically
converted to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/cygdrive/Z</TT
>.  The default
prefix of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/cygdrive</TT
> may be changed (see the
<A
HREF="using-utils.html#MOUNT"
>the section called <I
>mount</I
></A
> for more information).</P
><P
>It is possible to assign some special attributes to each mount
point.  Automatically mounted partitions are displayed as "auto"
mounts.  Mounts can also be marked as either "textmode" or "binmode"
-- whether text files are read in the same manner as binary files by
default or not (see <A
HREF="using-textbinary.html"
>the section called <I
>Text and Binary modes</I
></A
> for more
information on text and binary modes.</P

CLASS="ENVAR"

CLASS="ENVAR"

>, and
<TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT
> environment variables are automatically
converted from Win32 format to POSIX format (e.g.  from
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>c:\cygwin\bin</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin</TT
>, if
there was a mount from that Win32 path to that POSIX path) when a Cygwin
process first starts.</P
><P
>Symbolic links can also be used to map Win32 pathnames to POSIX.
For example, the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ln -s //pollux/home/joe/data /data</B
> would have about
the same effect as creating a mount point from
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>//pollux/home/joe/data</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/data</TT
>
using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
>, except that symbolic links cannot set
the default file access mode.  Other differences are that the mapping is
distributed throughout the file system and proceeds by iteratively
walking the directory tree instead of matching the longest prefix in a
kernel table.  Note that symbolic links will only work on network
drives that are properly configured to support the "system" file
attribute.  Many do not do so by default (the Unix Samba server does
not by default, for example).</P
