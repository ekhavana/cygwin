which you can choose by experimenting with those listed at

>Cygwin uses packages to manage installing various software. When
the default <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install from Internet</TT
> option is chosen,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> creates a local directory to store
the packages before actually installing the contents. 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Download from Internet</TT
> performs only the first
part (storing the packages locally), while 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install from Local Directory</TT
> performs only the 
second (installing the contents of the packages). </P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Download from Internet</TT
> option is mainly
for creating a base Cygwin package tree on one computer for 
installation on several machines with 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install from Local Directory</TT
>; copy the
entire local package tree to another machine with the directory
tree intact. For example, you might create a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C:\cache\</TT
>
directory and place <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> in it. Run 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install from Internet</TT
>
or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Download from Internet</TT
>, then copy the whole
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C:\cache\</TT
> to each machine and instead choose
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install from Local Directory</TT
>. Unfortunately
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> does not yet support unattended installs.</P
><P
>Though this provides some basic mirroring functionality, if you
are managing a wide Cygwin installation, to keep up to date we recommend 
using a mirroring tool such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>wget</B

the Cygwin mailing list created a simple demonstration script to accomplish
this; search the list for <B

Cygwin mirror, which allows <B

> to use 
multiple mirrors and custom packages. After installing Cygwin,
the cache is no longer necessary, but you may want to retain the
packages as backups, for installing Cygwin to another system,

Cygwin, you need to choose at least one mirror site.  Cygwin mirrors 
are geographically distributed around the world; check the list at <A
HREF="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html</A
>
to find one near you. You can select multiple mirrors by holding down
<TT

an unlisted mirror (for example, if your organization has an internal Cygwin 
mirror) you can add it.</P

><P
>For each selected mirror site, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> downloads a 
small text file called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setup.bz2</TT
> that contains a list
of packages available from that site along with some basic information about
each package which <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> parses and uses to create the 
chooser window. For details about the format of this file, see
<A

>http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin-apps/setup.html</A
>.</P
><P
>The chooser is the most complex part of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
>. 
Packages are grouped into categories, and one package may belong to multiple 
categories (assigned by the volunteer package maintainer). Each package
can be found under any of those categories in the heirarchial chooser view.
By default <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
>
will install only the packages in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Base</TT
> category
and their dependencies, resulting in a minimal Cygwin installation.
However, this will not include many commonly used tools such as 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> (which you will find in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Devel</TT
> 
category). </P
><P
>You can change <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
>'s view style, which is helpful
if you know the name of a package you want to install but not which 
category it is in. 
Click on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>View</TT
> button and it will rotate between 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Category</TT
> (the default), <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Full</TT
> (all 
packages), and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Partial</TT
> (only packages to be upgraded).
If you are familiar with Unix, you will probably want to at least glance 
through the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Full</TT
> listing for your favorite tools.</P
><P
>Once you have an existing Cygwin installation, the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
>
chooser is also used to manage your Cygwin installation. 
Information on installed packages is kept in the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/setup/</TT
> directory of your Cygwin installation; if 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> cannot find this directory it will act just like
you had no Cygwin installation.  If <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
>
finds a newer version of an installed package available, it will automatically 
mark it to be upgraded. 
To <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Uninstall</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Reinstall</TT
>, or get the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Source</TT
> for an existing package, click on 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Keep</TT
> to toggle it. 
Also, to avoid the need to reboot after upgrading, make sure
to close all Cygwin windows and stop all Cygwin processes before 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> begins to install the upgraded package.</P
><P
>The final feature of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> chooser is for
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Previous</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Experimental</TT
> packages.
By default the chooser shows only the current version of each package,
though mirrors have at least one previous version and occasionally there
is a testing or beta version of a package available. To see these package,
click on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Prev</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Exp</TT
> radio button.
Be warned, however, that the next time you run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> 
it will try to replace old or experimental versions with the latest. </P
