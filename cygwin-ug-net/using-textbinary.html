>The Issue</A
></H2
><P
>On a UNIX system, when an application reads from a file it gets
exactly what's in the file on disk and the converse is true for writing.
The situation is different in the DOS/Windows world where a file can
be opened in one of two modes, binary or text.  In the binary mode the
system behaves exactly as in UNIX.  However in text mode there are
major differences:</P
><P
></P
><OL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
TYPE="a"
><LI
><P
>On writing in text mode, a NL (\n, ^J) is transformed into the 
sequence CR (\r, ^M) NL.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>On reading in text mode, a CR followed by an NL is deleted and a ^Z
character signals the end of file.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>This can wreak havoc with the seek/fseek calls since the number
of bytes actually in the file may differ from that seen by the
application.</P
><P
>The mode can be specified explicitly as explained in the Programming
section below.  In an ideal DOS/Windows world, all programs using lines as
records (such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bash</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sed</B
> ...) would open files (and change the mode of their
standard input and output) as text.  All other programs (such as
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cmp</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tr</B
> ...)
would use binary mode.  In practice with Cygwin, programs that deal
explicitly with object files specify binary mode (this is the case of
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>od</B
>, which is helpful to diagnose CR problems).  Most
other programs (such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cmp</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tr</B
>) use the default mode.</P

>UNIX programs that have been written for maximum portability
will know the difference between text and binary files and act
appropriately under Cygwin.  For those programs, the text mode default
is a good choice.  Programs included in official Cygwin distributions
should work well in the default mode. </P
><P
>Text mode makes it much easier to mix files between Cygwin and
Windows programs, since Windows programs will usually use the CRLF
format.  Unfortunately you may still have some problems with text
mode.  First, some of the utilities included with Cygwin do not yet
specify binary mode when they should, e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat</B
> will
not work with binary files (input will stop at ^Z, CRs will be
introduced in the output). Second, you will introduce CRs in text
files you write, which can cause problems when moving them back to a
UNIX system. </P
><P
>If you are mounting a remote file system from a UNIX machine,
or moving files back and forth to a UNIX machine, you may want to
access the files in binary mode. The text files found there will normally
be in UNIX NL format, and you would want any files put there by Cygwin
programs to be stored in a format understood by UNIX.
Be sure to remove CRs from all Makefiles and
shell scripts and make sure that you only edit the files with
DOS/Windows editors that can cope with and preserve NL terminated lines.</P
><P
>Note that you can decide this on a disk by disk basis (for
example, mounting local disks in text mode and network disks in binary
mode).  You can also partition a disk, for example by mounting
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>c:</TT
> in text mode, and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>c:\home</TT
>
in binary mode.</P
