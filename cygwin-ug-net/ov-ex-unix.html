>If you are an experienced UNIX user who misses a powerful command-line
environment, you will enjoy Cygwin. Note that there are some workarounds
that cause Cygwin to behave differently than most UNIX-like operating
systems; these are described in more detail in 
<A
HREF="using-effectively.html"
>the Section called <I
>Using Cygwin effectively with Windows</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>.</P
><P
>Any time you want to update or install a Cygwin package, use the
graphical <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> program. By default,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> only installs a minimal set of packages, 
so look around and choose your favorite utilities on the package
selection screen. You may also search for specfic tools on the Cygwin
website's <A
HREF="http://cygwin.com/packages/"
TARGET="_top"
>Setup Package
Search</A
> For more information about what each option in
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setup.exe</B
> means, see <A
HREF="setup-net.html#INTERNET-SETUP"
>the Section called <I
>Internet Setup</I
> in Chapter 2</A
>. </P
><P
>Another option is to install everything by clicking on the
<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Default</VAR
> field next to the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>All</VAR
>
category. However, be advised that this will download and install
several hundreds of megabytes of software to your computer. The best
plan is probably to click on individual categories and install either
entire categories or packages from the categories themselves.</P

>Developers coming from a UNIX background will find a set of utilities
they are already comfortable using, including a working UNIX shell.  The
compiler tools are the standard GNU compilers most people will have previously
used under UNIX, only ported to the Windows host.  Programmers wishing to port
UNIX software to Windows NT or 9x will find that the Cygwin library provides
an easy way to port many UNIX packages, with only minimal source code
changes.</P
