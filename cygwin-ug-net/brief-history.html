>The first thing done was to enhance the development tools (gcc,
gdb, gas, et al) so that they could generate/interpret Win32 native
object files.</P
><P
>The next task was to port the tools to Win NT/9x. We could have
done this by rewriting large portions of the source to work within the
context of the Win32 API. But this would have meant spending a huge
amount of time on each and every tool. Instead, we took a
substantially different approach by writing a shared library
(the Cygwin DLL) that adds the necessary UNIX-like functionality
missing from the Win32 API (fork, spawn, signals, select, sockets,
etc.).  We call this new interface the Cygwin API. Once written, it
was possible to build working Win32 tools using UNIX-hosted
cross-compilers, linking against this library.</P
><P
>From this point, we pursued the goal of producing native tools
capable of rebuilding themselves under Windows 9x and NT (this is
often called self-hosting). Since neither OS ships with standard UNIX
user tools (fileutils, textutils, bash, etc...), we had to get the GNU
equivalents working with the Cygwin API. Most of these tools were
previously only built natively so we had to modify their configure
scripts to be compatible with cross-compilation. Other than the
configuration changes, very few source-level changes had to be
made. Running bash with the development tools and user tools in place,
Windows 9x and NT look like a flavor of UNIX from the perspective of
the GNU configure mechanism. Self hosting was achieved as of the beta
17.1 release.</P
