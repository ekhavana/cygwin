>To set bash up so that cut and paste work properly, click on the
"Properties" button of the window, then on the "Misc" tab.  Make sure
that "Quick Edit" is checked and "Fast Pasting" isn't.  These settings
will be remembered next time you run bash from that
shortcut. Similarly you can set the working directory inside the
"Program" tab. The entry "%HOME%" is valid.</P
><P
>Your home directory should contain three initialization files
that control the behavior of bash.  They are
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.bashrc</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.inputrc</TT
>.  These initialization files will only
be read if <VAR
CLASS="ENVAR"
>HOME</VAR
> is defined before starting bash.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
> (other names are also valid, see the bash man
page) contains bash commands.  It is executed when bash is started as login
shell, e.g. from the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bash --login</B
> (the provided
.bat file does not set the switch).  This is a useful place to define and
export environment variables and bash functions that will be used by bash
and the programs invoked by bash.  It is a good place to redefine
<VAR
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PATH</VAR
> if needed.  We recommend adding a ":." to the end of
<VAR
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PATH</VAR
> to also search the current working directory (contrary
to DOS, the local directory is not searched by default).  Also to avoid
delays you should either <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>unset</B
> <VAR
CLASS="ENVAR"
>MAILCHECK</VAR
> 
or define <VAR
CLASS="ENVAR"
>MAILPATH</VAR
> to point to your existing mail inbox.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.bashrc</TT
> is similar to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
> but is executed each time an interactive
bash shell is launched.  It serves to define elements that are not
inherited through the environment, such as aliases. If you do not use
login shells, you may want to put the contents of
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
> as discussed above in this file
instead.</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>shopt -s nocaseglob</PRE
>
will allow bash to glob filenames in a case-insensitive manner.
Note that <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.bashrc</TT
> is not called automatically for login 
shells. You can source it from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
>.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.inputrc</TT
> controls how programs using the readline
library (including bash) behave.  It is loaded automatically.  The
full details are in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>readline.info</TT
>. 
Due to a bug in the current readline version, 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.inputrc</TT
> cannot contain \r,
even on text mounted systems.
Consider the following settings:
<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
># Make Bash 8bit clean
set meta-flag on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on
# Ignore case while completing
set completion-ignore-case on</PRE
>
The first three commands allow bash to display 8-bit characters,
useful for languages with accented characters.  The last line makes
filename completion case insensitive, which can be convenient in a
Windows environment.</P
