>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> program is used to map your drives
and shares onto the simulated POSIX directory tree, much like as is
done by the POSIX mount command.  This is very similar to the old DOS
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>join</B
>, in that it makes your drive letters appear as
subdirectories somewhere else.  In POSIX operating systems (like
Linux(tm)) there is no concept of "drives" nor drive letters.  All
absolute paths begin with a slash instead of "c:" and all file systems
appear as subdirectories (for example, you might buy a new disk and
make it be the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/disk2</TT
> directory).  This practice
is simulated by cygwin to assist in porting POSIX programs to
Windows.</P
><P
>Normally, you'd just give the DOS/Windows equivalent path and
where you want it to show up in the simulated POSIX tree, like these
examples:</P

are special in most POSIX-like shells (like

using such a shell.</P
><P
>There are many opinions on what the "right" set of mounts is,
and the right one for you depends on how closely you want to simulate
a POSIX environment, whether you mix Windows and cygwin programs, and
how many drive letters you are using.  If you want to be very
POSIX-like, you may want to do something like this:

>However, if you mix Windows and Cygwin programs a lot, you might
want to create an "identity" mapping, so that conversions between the
two (see the cygpath command) can be eliminated:</P

>You'd have to repeat this for all top-level subdirectories on
all drives, but then you'd always have the top-level directories
available as the same names in both systems.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-b</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-t</TT
> options
change the default text file type for files found in that "mount
point".  The default is text, which means that cygwin will
automatically convert files between the POSIX text style (each line
ends with a NL character) and the Windows text style (each line ends
with a CR character and an LF character, or CRLF) as needed (the
program can, and should, explicitly specify text or binary file access
as needed, but not all do).</P
><P
>If your programs are properly written and know the difference
between text and binary files, the default (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-t</TT
>) is
a good choice.  You must use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-t</TT
> if you are going to
mix files between cygwin and Windows programs, since Windows programs
will always use the CRLF format.</P
><P
>If you are mounting a remote filesystem from a unix machine,
it's probably a good idea to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-b</TT
> as the text
files found there will normally be NL format anyway, and you would
want any files put there by cygwin programs to be stored in a format
that the unix machine will understand.</P
><P
>If you just type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> with no parameters, it
will display the current mount table for you.  Using
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--reset</TT
> will reset the mount table to its default
set of entries, which may include floppy and tape drives and
such.</P
><P
>You do not need to set up mounts for most devices in the POSIX
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> directory (like
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/null</TT
>) as these are simulated within cygwin
automatically.</P
