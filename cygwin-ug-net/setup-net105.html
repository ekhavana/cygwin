tools from your PATH environment variable so you do not execute them

>If you want the development tools and the programs necessary to
run the GNU configure mechanism, you should download the full binary
release called `cygwinfull.exe'.  If you only care about the user
tools listed above, download `cygwinuser.exe' instead.</P
><P
>If you have an unreliable connection, download the appropriate
binary in smaller chunks instead.  For the split full installer, get
the files in the `full-split' subdirectory.  Once downloaded,
combine the split files at the command prompt by doing a:</P

del xa*.*</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>A similar process can be used for the user tools.</P
><P
>Once you have an install executable on your system, run
it.  First off, the installer will prompt you for a location to extract
the temporary files it needs to install the release on your
system. The default should be fine for most people.</P
><P
>Next it will ask you to choose an install location.  The default
is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>system-drive</I
></TT
>:\cygnus\cygwin-b20</TT
>.
Feel free to choose another location if you would prefer.</P
><P
>Finally, it will ask you for the name of the Program Files
folder shortcut to add.  By default, the installer will create a
`Cygwin B20' entry in a folder called `Cygnus Solutions'. When this
step is completed, it will install the tools and exit.</P
><P
>At this point, you should be able to look under the start menu
and select "Cygwin Beta 20" (or whatever you named it). This will
pop up a bash shell with all special environment variables set up for
you. If you are running Windows 95 or 98 and are faced with the error
message "Out of environment space", you need to increase the amount of
environment space in your config.sys and try again. Adding the line
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p</B
> should do the trick
if C: is your system drive letter.</P
><P
>There are two remaining thing you should do from this
prompt. First, you need to type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mkdir -p /tmp</B
> to
ensure that a directory for temporary files exists for programs that
expect to find one there.</P
><P
>Second, if you are installing the full distribution
(<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>full.exe</TT
>), various programs will need to
be able to find `/bin/sh'.  You should `mkdir -p /bin' and put a copy of
`sh.exe' there, removing the older version, if present.  You can use
the `mount' utility to select which drive letter is mounted as
`/'.  See the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for more
information on `mount'.</P
><P
>If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.</P
