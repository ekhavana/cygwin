<h2>Cygwin</h2>

<ul>The <A HREF="http://cygutils.fruitbat.org/">CygUtils</A> collection contains ports of many useful
utilities, with build instructions, from Chuck Wilson.</ul>

<h2>Mingw</h2>

<ul><a href="http://www.mingw.org/">Mingw</a> is a gcc compiler configuration that does without the
Cygwin Unix emulation layer.  Instead, it uses the Microsoft MSVCRT as
its C library.  If you want a Win32 native compiler without Unix
support, this is for you!  The Cygwin compiler includes a new -mno-cygwin
flag that pulls in the Mingw libraries instead of Cygwin.</ul>

<h2>Other relevant projects</h2>

<ul>The <a "http://mingw.org">MinGW project</a> provides pure windows
versions of some of the programs distributed with Cygwin, including
gcc, binutils, make, etc.

<ul>If you are interested in DOS-based GNU tools, see the
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP Home Page</a>.  DJGPP is a
somewhat similar project that is concentrating on DOS-hosted tools.</ul>
