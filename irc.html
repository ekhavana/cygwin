<h1>Are there chat channels for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes, indeed.  There are two offical IRC channels on
<a href="https://www.freenode.net/">Freenode.net</a>.</p>

<p>The Freenode channel <b>#cygwin</b> is for user communication and
user questions.  This is the right channel if you want to discuss
running Cygwin and problems with Cygwin setup, etc.
It's <b>not</b> a bug report channel.  For this, use the
<a href="lists.html">Cygwin mailing list</a>.  Help on the mailing
list will also be of higher quality, usually, but for the occasional
problem discussion, the <b>#cygwin</b> channel is pretty neat.</p>

<p>The Freenode channel <b>#cygwin-developers</b> is reserved for
communication between Cygwin developers and Cygwin package maintainers.
It's <b>not</b> a channel for reporting bugs and it's <b>not</b> a
channel for idle "it would be nice if Cygwin ..." type of discussion.
Only join this channel if you honestly, seriously want to get your
hands dirty and work for the project.  Otherwise, expect to be ignored.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Cygwin itself comes with a few IRC clients like <b>ii</b>,
<b>irssi</b>, <b>naim</b>, <b>tinyirc</b>, <b>tirc</b> and <b>weechat</b>.
Please see the Freenode homepage for help setting up your IRC client to
connect to Freenode.</p>
