<h1>Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several.  They are listed below.</p>
<p>However, please check out the <a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, the
<a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/">documentation</a>,
and the <a href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html">problem reporting guidelines</a> before
sending email to a mailing list.</p>

<div id="background">
<b class="rtop"><b class="r1"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r4"></b></b>
<a name="see-above"><h2>I have a question!  Should I just send it to one (or all) of the mailing lists below?</h2></a>
<b class="rbottom"><b class="r4"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r1"></b></b>
</div><br>

<p>That depends.  Have you adequately researched your question already?
Cygwin is not a new project.  It has been around for many years.
That means that almost any question that you are burning to ask has
probably already been asked.  Almost every observation that you can make
has probably been made.  Almost every suggestion for improvement that
you can think of has probably been suggested.</p>

<p>So, rather than send YA "same old" observation to one of the mailing lists
below, and possibly be flamed as a result, you <em>owe it to yourself</em>
to do some background research before posting.</p>

<p>Places to check for information would be the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/faq/">Cygwin FAQ</a>, the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/docs.html">Cygwin documentation</a>, the <a
href="http://google.com/">web</a>, and the mailing list archives (click
on a mailing list name <a href="#available-lists">below</a> to search
the archive).  Using one of these methods, it's likely that you'll be
able to find the answers that you seek without sending email to
thousands of people and you'll have the satisfaction of having gained
valuable research skills.</p>

<p>This may seem like we're discouraging questions.  Well, you are
right.  We are discouraging <em>repeat</em> questions.  The Cygwin
mailing list is a high volume list.  Every question you send there will
potentially be read by thousands of people.  Many people will sigh and
shake their heads when they see the same old question asked for the
hundredth time.  Is this how you want to introduce yourself to the
Cygwin community?  We think not.</p>

<p>Now that we've discouraged you, let us say that despite the fact that
there is an incredible number of messages going to the Cygwin mailing
lists, there are still a lot of friendly folk who will probably try to
answer your "newbie" (shudder) questions.  However, if you are going to
ask a question, you owe it to yourself and your new acquaintances to ask
an <a href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html"><b>intelligent question</b></a>.
No one is "on staff" waiting for your email so no one needs to
respond to clueless, vague, content-free, or repetitive queries or
observations.  This means that if you <em>want to receive help</em> you
need to present yourself in such a fashion that people will want to help
you.  So, think thrice, post once -- and when you post make sure that
you have also looked at the <a href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html">problem reporting guidelines</a>
so that you will be sure to provide <a href="http://cygwin.com/problems.html#cygcheck">all of the information</a>
needed to debug your problem.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure when you send a message to a Cygwin list that it
actually has <em>something to do with Cygwin</em>.  What do we mean by
that?  Well, if you can't install the Cygwin C compiler, then that has
something to do with Cygwin.  If you don't know C very well and need
some pointers on writing a program, that really has nothing to do with
Cygwin.  If you are trying to run the Cygwin version of <tt>bash</tt>
(the standard <b>UNIX</b> shell) and it hangs, then that's probably a
Cygwin problem.  If you can't figure out how to set up a command alias
in <tt>bash</tt>, that's <em>not</em> a Cygwin question.  These Cygwin
questions are considered "on topic".  The non-Cygwin questions are
considered "off topic".</p>

<p>Why do we make this distinction?  For two reasons:  1) as mentioned,
the email traffic is very high so, by keeping things "on topic" we
can cut down on some list traffic and 2) there are usually much better
places on the Internet where you can get definitive answers for your
off-topic-for-Cygwin question.  It doesn't make sense to ask non-experts to teach you about
C or bash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't tell you exactly where to go with your non-Cygwin
questions.  <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> is a wonderful resource
for finding things on the web, though.  It's likely that a few well-chosen
search terms will uncover scads of information.</p>
<p>'Nuff said.</p>

  <li><a name="cygwin"><a href="/ml/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a></a>: a <em>high volume</em> list
      for <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of just about all things related to the Cygwin community
      release.  If you have questions about how to use Cygwin, or if you have <em>Cygwin-specific</em>
      (<a href="#see-above">see above</a>) questions, bugs, or observations about the UNIX tools (bash, gcc, make, etc.) that come with Cygwin,
      this is the list for you (although it's very possible that you will receive more qualified help for such tools on their specific non-Cygwin mailing lists).  There are <b>a few exceptions</b> to the "all things Cygwin"
      nature of this list:
      <br><br><ul>
      <li>Questions about the Cygwin/X project (or any X-related questions for Cygwin)
      should go to the cygwin-xfree mailing list (see below).</li>
      <li>Patches <em>for the Cygwin DLL</em> should go to the cygwin-patches mailing list
      (see below).</li>
      <li>New package submissions should go to the cygwin-apps mailing list (see below).</li>
      <li>Questions about Cygwin licensing, copyright, and GPL issues should go to the moderated
      cygwin-licensing list  (see below).</li>
      <li>Questions about other Cygwin releases not downloaded from http://cygwin.com/ or its
      mirrors are strongly discouraged.  In theory, there should be better forums for
      discussing this kind of unsponsored software than the Cygwin mailing list.
      <p>This caveat applies to all of the mailing lists at this site.</p></li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-licensing"><a href="/ml/cygwin-licensing/"><b>cygwin-licensing</b></a></a>: a low volume, moderated
      list set up to provide answers and limited discussion about Cygwin licensing.  Please ask questions
      here if you are unclear about Red Hat licensing or Cygwin's standard GPL licensing.  The
     <a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a> and the
     <a href="http://cygwin.com/licensing.html">Cygwin Licensing Page</a> are <em>mandatory</em>
     reading before posting here.  First time posters should indicate that they have read both of
     these before sending a question or risk having their message rejected.</a>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-talk"><a href="/ml/cygwin-talk/"><b>cygwin-talk</b></a></a>: a
      mindless chatter list for discussing things that are tangentially related to Cygwin.  This list is intended to be funny but not terribly helpful.   <b>Do <em>not</em> send technical questions about Cygwin here.  Use the <a href="#cygwin">main Cygwin mailing list</a>
      for serious Cygwin questions since responses to technical questions
      in this list are not guaranteed to be serious or definitive.</b>
      No profanity, no commercial posts, and minimal flaming, please.</li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-xfree"><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree/"><b>cygwin-xfree</b></a></a>: a list for 
      <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of all things related to the version X
      on Cygwin (Cygwin/X) which is distributed from the Cygwin site. If you have
      questions about how to use, configure, install, build, or develop with

  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-announce"><a href="/ml/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a></a>: a 
      moderated announcement list solely for announcements related to the official
      Cygwin release.  Announcements sent to cygwin-anounce are automatically sent to
      the Cygwin mailing list so there is no reason to subscribe to both mailing
      lists if your only intent is to be up-to-date on new package releases.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-xfree-announce"><a href="/ml/cygwin-xfree-announce/"><b>cygwin-xfree-announce</b></a></a>: a

      subscriber-only list for <b>discussing  <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">packaging</a> issues regarding
      applications that are distributed with the Cygwin DLL</b>.  If you are maintaining
      or volunteering to maintain one of the packages that is distributed with the Cygwin net releases you should be
      subscribed to this list.  This list is intended for discussing solutions.
      It is <b>not</b> (with one exception) for <em>bug reports</em>, <em>"it would be nice"</em>, or <em>"how do I"</em>
      type of musings.  Do not subsccribe to this mailing list to ask questions about packages.  Use the main Cygwin mailing list for that.
      <br><br>Here's the one exception:  This mailing list is the preferred location for
      design discussions of Cygwin's <a href="http://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">setup.exe</a> program.
  </li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-patches"><a href="/ml/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a></a>: a 
      list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL</b> and the other components
      of the "winsup" directory, excluding the mingw and w32api directory which are handled by the
      <a href="http://mingw.org/">MinGW</a> project.  Discussions of supplied patches are also
      acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may submit email to this list.
  </p></li>

  <p><li><a name="cygwin-developers"><a href="/ml/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a></a>: a 
      subscribers-only list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin
      DLL</b> and all cygwin components of the "winsup" directory (excluding the mingw and w32api directories).  Discussions of
      upcoming net releases are also appropriate.  Please do not subscribe or send
      email to this list if you do not understand what is meant by "the winsup directory".
      If you are interested in <a href="contrib.html">contributing</a> to the development
      of Cygwin, this is the place to discuss your plans.
   <br><br>Note that this is <em>not</em> a place to send bug reports or questions about utilities
      like ssh, cron, etc.   Please use the main Cygwin list for these types of questions.
      If you have an issue and hope that someone will look into it for you then please do
      not send email here.  This is a mailing list for doers not musers.</p>

   <br><br>Discussion of the <em>mingw</em> and <em>w32api</em> directories should be directed to <a href="http://mingw.org/">mingw.org</a>.
  </li>
  <p><li><a name="cygwin-cvs"><a href="/ml/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a></a>: a read-only list which receives log messages
      for every CVS commit in the 'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then
      you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to diffs
      of the changes.
