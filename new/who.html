<h1>Who are we?*</h1>
<ul>
<li>Christopher Faylor (cgf) is one of the project leads.  Chris works
for Netapp but all of his Cygwin activities occur on his own time.  He
is most notably responsible for the support of signal handling and
fork/exec in Cygwin.  He also administer's the <a href="http://sourceware.org/">
site</a> which hosts the cygwin web site and release.

<br><br><li>Corinna Vinschen (corinna) is the other project lead.  Corinna is a
senior Red Hat engineer.  Corinna is responsible for such important
subsystems as security and networking and has recently added support to
Cygwin for wide characters and increased path length.

<br><br><li>Yaakov Selkowitz is the <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a>
coordinator.  Jon Turney serves on the <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a>
team as a developer.

<br><br><li>The <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">Cygwin setup</a> project
is currently maintained by the project leads and Dave Korn.  Dave also provides support for GCC.

<br><br><li>Eric Blake (eblake) maintains bash, coreutils, and several other
vitally important packags.

<br><br><li>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat,
Inc.) but the majority of package maintainership and a significant
percentage of Cygwin development is handled by non-Red Hat
volunteers.

<br><br><li>Like many <a href="http://sourceware.org/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sourceware.org, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Sergey Okhapkin,
Egor Duda, Chuck Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason
Tishler, Robert Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin,
Chris January, Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, Pierre Humblet, Igor
Peshansky, Brian Dessent, Brian Ford, and Jari Aalto.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>* Please note that all of the people above prefer that project related
communications go to the proper mailing list rather than private email.</p>
