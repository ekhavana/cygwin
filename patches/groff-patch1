Thankyou very much to all who helped me with my problem.
Especially, thanks to Geoffrey Noer and David Jeffers who
were very patient with me. For all who want to use
the "famous" groff under Windows95 here a summary with
the necessary steps:

- replace the C++-library libstdc++ from version B16
  with B14 (I think in further versions this is no more
  necessary )

- uncompress the groff-stuff (groff-1.10.tar.gz) to a
  working directory. This can be done with winzip, a
  very good tool.

- Delete lines 623 - 703 in the file: configure.

- Replace "PROG=xx" with "PROG=xx.exe" (xx is the name
  of the program) in the files Makefile.sub in the
  subdirectories. (So the executables with correct 
  extensions will be built)

- Replace all ocurrences of: "-o conftest" with 
  "-o conftest.exe"

- Type 'configure --program-suffix=.exe'

- Type "make all". Now all binaries with correct 
  extensions should be built. 

- Type "make install" for installing the code.
