<h2><a id="naming">Package file naming scheme</a></h2>
<p>
  Use the upstream's version plus a release suffix (i.e. findutils 4.5.12
  becomes 4.5.12-1, 4.5.12-2, etc., until findutils 4.5.13 is packaged, which
  would be 4.5.13-1, etc). Some packages also use a YYYYMMDD format for their
  versions, e.g. terminfo-5.9-20140524-1.tar.xz. The first release of a package
  should have a -1 release suffix.
</p>

<p>A complete package currently consists of three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a binary tar file, named <tt>package-version-release.tar.xz</tt></li>
  <li>a source tar file, named <tt>package-version-release-src.tar.xz</tt></li>
  <li>a .hint file, named  <tt>package-version-release.hint</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
bash$ ls -1 release/boffo
boffo-1.0-1.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1-src.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1.hint
</pre>

<p>Binary tar files generally contain the executable files that will be
  installed on a user's system plus any auxiliary files needed by the
  package. See the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section
  below for more details on the contents of a binary tar file.
</p>

<p>Source tar files should contain the source files, patches and scripts needed
  to rebuild the package. While installing these files is optional, the
  inclusion of a source tar file is part of the totality that makes up a Cygwin
  package and so, these files are <em>not</em> optional. In some cases, there
  may be multiple packages generated from the same source; for instance, one
  might have a "boffo" package and its associated shared library in "libboffo7",
  where both are generated from the same source tar file. See
  the <a href="#package_contents">package contents</a> section below for more
  details on the contents of a source tar file, and
  the <a href="packaging-hint-files.html#advanced_pvr.hint">package-version-release.hint</a>
  section for information on the "external-source:" option.
</p>

<p>
  Note that package files may be .bz2, .gzip or .xz compressed.  .gzip is
  deprecated and .xz is preferred for new package submissions.
</p>

<p>
  The version and release <b>must</b> start with a digit.
  The release <b>must not</b> contain a hyphen.
</p>

<p>
  Version and release sort according to the following rules:
  <ul>
    <li>Contiguous chunks of digits or non-digits are compared</li>
    <li>Non-digit chunks sort before digit chunks</li>
    <li>Digit chunks sort numerically and non-digit chunks sort lexicographically</li>
    <li>If all chunks are equal, the string with any suffix remaining is the greater</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  A package with a higher version is greater, regardless of the release.  When
  two packages have an identical version, the one with the higher release is
  greater.
</p>

<h2><a id="package_contents">Package contents</a></h2>
<p>
  The files paths within both the source and the binary package files are quite
  important. Since setup extracts into a predetermined directory, you must
  structure your package contents accordingly.
</p>
<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    Binary packages are extracted in /, include all file paths from the root in
    your archive, e.g.:
<pre>
usr/bin/boffo.exe
usr/share/boffo/boffo.dat
etc...
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The package is configured using (at a minimum) the following paths:
<pre>
--prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc
--libexecdir=/usr/lib
--localstatedir=/var
--datadir=/usr/share
--mandir=/usr/share/man
--infodir=/usr/share/info
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>All executables in your binary package are stripped.</li>
  <li>Source packages are extracted in /usr/src (so the paths in your source tar
  file should not include /usr/src). On extraction, the tar file should put the
  sources in a directory with the same name as the package tar file minus the
  -src.tar.xz part:
<pre>
boffo-1.0-1/boffo.cygport
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0.tar.xz
boffo-1.0-1/boffo-1.0-1.src.patch
etc...
</pre>
  <p>Generally, this will contain the original source tar file, exactly as
     downloaded from the original upstream, any needed patch files, and a
     cygport script that drives the packaging process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package, you may choose to include a file
    /usr/share/doc/Cygwin/foo-vendor-suffix.README containing (at a minimum) the
    information needed for an end user to recreate the package. This includes
    CFLAGS settings, configure parameters, etc.  (You can
    adapt <a href="https://sourceware.org/viewvc/cygwin-apps/packaging/templates/generic-readme?view=co">this
    generic README</a>.)
  </li>
  <li>In your binary package include a directory /usr/share/doc/foo/ that
  includes any binary-relevant upstream documentation, such as ChangeLogs,
  copyright licences, READMEs etc. </li>
  <li>If you are not creating your package from an installed virtual root, be
  sure to check that the file permissions are appropriate. </li>
  <li>If the package has any global settings (i.e. in files in /etc) that are
  not overrideable on a per user basis (sshd, as a daemon, is an example of
  this) do not include the relevant config files in your package. Instead
  install the files into /etc/defaults and include in your post-install script
  to install the settings files. Be sure that if you would overwrite an already
  present file that the user is offered the choice of keeping their own or
  overwriting with your defaults. </li>
  <li>Ensure that your package handles being installed on binary and text mounts
  correctly. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="postinstall">Creating a package postinstall script</a></h2>
<p>
  If your package requires certain commands to be executed after the files in
  the package are installed, include them in a file in the package called
  /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.sh or
  /etc/postinstall/<var>package</var>.bat.
</p>
<p>
  If the file's name ends in ".sh", it is executed with the Cygwin shell; if it
  ends in ".bat", it is executed with the DOS command interpreter. If it doesn't
  end with either of these suffixes, it is ignored.
</p>
<p>
  After the script has been successfully run it is renamed by appending the
  suffix ".done" to its previous name, to prevent it from being run again the
  next time the user runs the setup program.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the setup program runs all the postinstall scripts after all desired
  packages have been installed, that is, it does not run each package's
  postinstall script immediately after installing that package. Note,
  furthermore, that the order in which the scripts are run is not
  guaranteed. Therefore, if your package depends on others which have their own
  postinstall scripts, you cannot assume in your script that the other packages'
  scripts have already been run.
