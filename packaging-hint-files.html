<p>Each package must be submitted with a file
called <tt>package-version-release.hint</tt>. This file is used for information
that cannot be inferred just from the context of the file name or package
name. Lines in <tt>package-version-release.hint</tt> will consist of one of the
following:</p>
<pre>
# <i>comment</i>
sdesc: <i>"some text"</i>
ldesc: <i>"some text"</i>
skip:

</pre>
<p align="center">
  <b>Note: Not all of the above lines are required. Please read the description
  below for further details on how to construct a package-version-release.hint
  file.</b>
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    <p>Use UTF-8 character encoding.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Lines that begin with '#' are comments and are ignored.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>skip</tt> line indicates that that package should not appear in
      setup. It is intended for directories that exist in the hierarchy that
      should not be considered.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not required, as it is only useful for indicating directories
      which contain source-only packages, which are automatically recognized,
      irrespective of 'skip'.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <tt>sdesc</tt> is a one line description of the package, enclosed in
      double-quotes.  This is the information that will be displayed when
      installing packages via setup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the package name should <em>not</em> be part of the
      description, e.g. this is incorrect:
    </p>

<pre>
sdesc:      "boffo: A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>

    <p>
      This is correct:
    </p>

<pre>
sdesc:      "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
</pre>

    <p>
      <tt>sdesc</tt> is a mandatory line.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <tt>ldesc</tt> is a more descriptive, multi-line description of the
      package, enclosed in double-quotes.  It is intended for future use. e.g.:
    </p>

<pre>
ldesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>

    <p>
      Note that there is currently no method for escaping double-quotes, so
       there is no way to represent a double-quote embedded in
       the <tt>ldesc</tt>.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>category</tt> line indicates the categories that this package
      belongs to. One package can belong to multiple categories. Multiple
      categories are separated by spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do not enclose multiple category names within quotation marks.
    </p>

    <a id="categories"/>
    <p>
      Please do not invent a new category without checking with the cygwin-apps

    <p>
      As you can see, currently, all categories consist of only a single
      word. We don't anticipate that this will change anytime soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      <tt>category</tt> is a mandatory line.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>requires</tt> line indicates the packages that this package relies
      on. If your package is dependent on a file provided by another package
      that other package should be included here. The requires field may be
      missing or empty if your package truly does not require any other package.
    </p>

    <p>
      A package can rely on multiple other packages. Hierarchical dependencies
      should work correctly, however, it is best to always include specific
      dependencies, i.e. don't drop '<tt>bar</tt>' from your dependency list if
      your package requires it, even if you are including '<tt>foo</tt>' which
      relies on '<tt>bar</tt>'.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, do not include package dependencies of <em>dependent</em>
      packages in your dependency list. If you think that another package has an
      incorrect dependency list, send email to cygwin-apps noting that fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiple packages are separated by spaces. Do not enclose multiple package
      names within quotation marks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>message</tt> line indicates text that will be displayed by the
      setup program when the package is installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should be used <i>extremely</i> sparingly, for example, if a 3rd
      party driver or service needs to be installed in Windows for the package
      to function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The id used should be derived from the package name. Currently, the text
      for a given id will be shown by setup exactly once, when the package is
      first installed, even if the text subsequently changes.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of a complete <i>release/boffo/boffo-1.0-1.hint</i>:</p>
<pre>
category: Games Text
requires: libncurses6 cygwin
sdesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art"
ldesc:    "A whackamole simulation in ASCII art.
Intended for use on VT100 terminals at BAUD rates 1200 and
above.  Uses arrow keys for positioning over moles.  Space
bar whacks the mole.
No actual moles will be harmed during execution of this game."
</pre>

<div class="background">
  <b class="rtop"><b class="r1"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r4"></b></b>
  <h2><a id="advanced_pvr.hint"><tt>package-version-release.hint</tt> file (Advanced Options)</a></h2>
  <b class="rbottom"><b class="r4"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r1"></b></b>
</div>

<p>The <tt>external-source</tt> line is used when multiple installation packages are generated from a single source package. For example, suppose the <tt>boffo</tt> package contains the executables and documentation for boffo, but there is also a shared library <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> that might be used by other packages; say, the <tt>fobbo</tt> program. It would be nice to separate that <tt>cygboffo-7.dll</tt> shared library into a second installation package, so that users of the <tt>fobbo</tt> program can install <em>just</em> the library, and not the entire <tt>boffo</tt> package. However, all of the <tt>boffo</tt> executables and the DLL are generated from the same source. To support this usage, the <tt>boffo</tt> maintainer would create three package files:</p>
<ul class="compact">
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains all of the normal contents of <tt>boffo</tt> -- except for the shared library.</li>
  <li><tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>: an installable package that contains only the shared library from <tt>boffo</tt></li>
  <li><tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>: the source package for boffo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>, <tt>boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz</tt>, and <tt>boffo-2.4.1-2.hint</tt> would go into the <tt>release/boffo/</tt> subdirectory.
  <tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz</tt>, and <tt>libboffo7-2.4.1-2.hint</tt> would go into a separate subdirectory, such as <tt>release/boffo/libboffo7/</tt>.
  The two <tt>.hint</tt> files would look something like this:</p>
<center>
  <table border="2">
    <tr>

<p>The setup.ini generated from these .hint files will include these lines (only relevant lines shown):</p>
<pre>
@ boffo
requires: libboffo7 libncurses6 cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
@ libboffo7
requires: cygwin
version: 2.4.1-2
install: release/boffo/libboffo7/libboffo7-2.4.1-2.tar.xz
source: release/boffo/boffo-2.4.1-2-src.tar.xz
</pre>

<p>
  Note that both packages point to the same source tar file. Also, it is required
  that the versions match (libboffo7-5.2 can't point to boffo-1.4-src). The same
  logic is used to "match up" prev: and test: versions with their external
  sources.
</p>

<div class="background">
  <b class="rtop"><b class="r1"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r4"></b></b>
  <h2><a id="override.hint"><tt>override.hint</tt> file</a></h2>
  <b class="rbottom"><b class="r4"></b><b class="r3"></b><b class="r2"></b><b class="r1"></b></b>
</div>

<p>
  An <tt>override.hint</tt> file</a> may exist, for information not associated
  with a specific <i>version-release</i>.
</p>

<pre>
# <i>comment</i>
curr: <i>version</i>
prev: <i>version</i>
test: <i>version</i>
</pre>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li>
    <p>Lines that begin with '#' are comments and are ignored.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The <tt>curr</tt>, <tt>prev</tt>, and <tt>test</tt> lines indicate which
      versions of that package should be used. Use these settings <em>only</em>
      if you need to circumvent the normal version ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the highest version-release number is used for the current
      version of a package; the next highest (if any) is used for the previous
      version.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use of <tt>curr</tt> and <tt>prev</tt> is usually not required, given this
      version ordering. So, e.g. if you had previously
      released <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt> and now have a new <tt>boffo-1.0-1</tt>, the
      version ordering matches the default and there is no need to
      use <tt>curr</tt> or <tt>prev</tt>, as <tt>1.0-1</tt> is greater
      than <tt>0.9-1</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you had discovered a serious error in the <tt>boffo-1.0</tt>
      release, and then decided that you want to drop back
      to <tt>boffo-0.9-1</tt>, you could include entries like this:
    </p>

<pre>
prev: 1.0-1
curr: 0.9-1
</pre>

    <p>
      This usage should be rare, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, you should trust setup to "do the right thing" -- with one
      exception. If you decide that you need to release a <i>test</i> version of
      your package, there is no way for setup to know that.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, you will have to put something like "<tt>test: 1.9-1</tt>". This will
      cause setup to characterize the 1.9-1 version as a "test" package. With
      the current setup implementation, it will also mean that it will be
      overlooked by most people during installation. So, unless you have made
      arrangements to advertise your test release, this option should be used
      sparingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setup is currently unable to list more than three versions of each
      package. Therefore you should not keep more than three versions of each
      package around: The current version, the previous stable version, and,
      optionally, one test version. By keeping a previous stable version around,
      you isolate yourself (somewhat) from problems with partial mirrors. When
      you add a new "current" version, you can either keep the old "previous"
      version, or make the old current version the new previous version,
      depending on how stable they each were.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not required that your package have a <tt>test</tt> version. Use of
      a <tt>test</tt> version of a package is at the discretion of the package
      maintainer.
    </p>
