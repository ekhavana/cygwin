<h1>Mirror Sites</h1>

<p>The following sites have generously agreed to mirror our main Cygwin
ftp site.  To save on download time, please choose a mirror site near
you when selecting a mirror when using setup
to <a href="install.html">install or update</a> Cygwin.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> We <em>automatically</em> poll the mirror list on a
regular basis to ensure that sites have the latest <a
href="packages">Cygwin packages</a> available.  The list of sites below
reflects all of the sites who appear to have up-to-date copies of the
Cygwin release area.</p>

<p>
<b>There is <a href="#mirroradmin">more information for Mirror Administrators</a>.</b><br/>

<p>If you would like to be added to this list of available mirrors then
send email to <b>sourcemaster</b> at this site.  <b>sourcemaster</b> is
a mailing list on this site.  You really can send email to it.  However,
when you send your mesage, remember that this site does not accept <a
href="http://sourceware.org/lists.html#html-mail">html-formatted
email</a>.</p>

<p>When asking to be added, please provide contact information, the URL
of the mirror, and location of the mirror.  Location should be provided
similarly to what is listed in the <a href="#sitelist">site list</a>.
Make sure that your mirror rsyncs directly from cygwin.com at least
twice a day.  If your mirror site has up-to-date content, once it is
added, it will show up here automatically.</p>

<p>Please do not send questions asking how to set up a mirror.  We don't
provide technical support for setting up mirrors.  Sorry.</p>

<p>The mirror list is <b>automatically maintained</b>.  This means that
only active mirrors are listed.  There is no hand-editing of the list.
It is maintained by <em>a program</em>.  So, if your site was dropped
from the list it means that a program has determined that the files on
your site are not up-to-date.  Unless your site has been out of date for
(currently) 100 runs of the program, it will be re-added automatically
when it becomes current.  So, if you see that your site has been dropped
from the mirrors list do not panic.  <em>There is no need to contact
anyone about this</em>.</p>

<p>Given the granularity of checking, it is possible that your site will
be polled after a package update on cygwin.com but before your site has
pulled the update.  So, it is <em>expected</em> that from, time-to-time,
your site may fall off the mirror list <em>temporarily</em>.  If your
mirror site has not been listed for a day or so that means that some
cygwin packages on your site are not current.  Check the <a
href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/current/">cygwin-announce
archives</a> for announcements about recent package updates and ensure
that your site has those packages.  Once your site has the recent
packages it will be re-added automatically.</p>
