<h1>Cygwin Package Server</h1>

<p>
This page documents how to create a directory tree that Cygwin's
setup program understands.  Please note that the instructions on this
page work at the present time, but may change in the future. They are provided
on a strictly as-is basis.
</p>

<p>
They should be useful for creating a local mirror with or without custom Cygwin
packages. At the present, we recommend using an Apache web server running on a
Linux distribution, but all the required software should work properly on
Cygwin.
</p>

<h2>Creating a local Cygwin mirror with rsync</h2>

<p>
You do not need to know anything about how the directory tree is created if
you just want a copy of an existing directory tree. Simply follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li> The first step in creating a local Cygwin mirror is to pick which
  existing mirror you will download your packages from. A list of
  mirrors can be found <a href="mirrors.html">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Download the current Cygwin directory tree.
  If disk space is a problem, you may want to use a
  public mirror and only add your own custom packages as described in the
  next section.  (Substitute your chosen mirror
  for <em>example.com</em> and your DocumentRoot for <em>/var/www/</em>):
  <pre>
    rsync -vaz rsync://<em>example.com/pub/cygwin/ /var/www/</em>cygwin
  </pre>
</li>
<li>
  Test the mirror by pointing a browser at
  <tt>http://<em>your-server</em>/cygwin/</tt>.
  If your server is configured to show directory indexes, you should see
  the various <i>arch</i> directories, each containing a <tt>release</tt>
  directory and the compressed <tt>setup.ini</tt> files.
  Run Cygwin's setup program and type the URL of your server.
</li>
<li>
  Assuming everything works properly, you are almost done. You now have
  a current Cygwin mirror, but you need to keep it updated by running the
  <tt>rsync</tt> command periodically. The easiest way to do this is by
  putting it in your <tt>crontab</tt>.
</li>
</ol>

<a id="overlay"></a>
<h2>Creating an overlay Cygwin package server</h2>

<p>
  TBD.
</p>

<a id="custom-mirror"></a>

<h2>Creating a custom Cygwin package server</h2>
<p>NOTE: The instructions below may be out of date.  If you are running a
custom package server and can update this documentation, please send it to the
cygwin-apps list.
</p>

<p>
The contents of the directory tree are described to setup by a
(compressed) <tt>setup.ini</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
This file is generated by the script <tt>mksetupini</tt>, from the <tt>calm</tt>
package.  It can be downloaded from git and used to create a custom Cygwin
package server.
</p>

<p>
If you are planning on creating a custom package
server, we strongly recommend subscribing to the cygwin-apps mailing list
where changes in the <tt>setup.ini</tt> format and <tt>calm</tt> are
discussed and announced.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Obtain the <tt>mksetupini</tt> script, on Cygwin by installing
  the <tt>calm</tt> Cygwin package, or directly from
  <a href="https://cygwin.com/git/?p=cygwin-apps/calm.git">Cygwin-apps git</a>.

  <pre>
    pip3 install git+http://sourceware.org/git/cygwin-apps/calm.git
  </pre>

</li>
<li>
  Create a directory to store your files (i.e., the arch/release/ directory
  tree).  I use <tt>/var/www/custom-cygwin/</tt>.  If you also created a local
  mirror as described above, you can link those files:
  <pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    mkdir custom-cygwin
    cd custom-cygwin
    for ARCH in x86 x86_64 noarch ; do
      mkdir -p ${ARCH}/release
      cd ${ARCH}/release
      ln -s /var/www/cygwin/${ARCH}/release/* .
      cd ../..
    done</pre>
  That way you can use only your custom mirror to get all the packages.  Note
  that whenever a new package is uploaded, you will need to link its directory
  to your custom mirror.
</li>
<li>
  Add your custom package(s) to the directory tree.
</li>
<li> (Optional) Since packages in <tt>Base</tt> category are always installed,
  you can add an empty package in the <tt>Base</tt> category that depends on
  several other packages to automatically install them for anyone using your
  custom mirror. For example:
  <pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    mkdir custompackage
    cd custompackage
    touch custompackage-0.0.1-1.tar.bz2
    touch custompackage-0.0.1-1-src.tar.bz2
    cat &gt; setup.hint &lt;&lt; EOF
      @ custompackage
      sdesc: "My favorite packages"
      ldesc: "My favorite packages"
      category: Base
      requires: bzip2 clear cygwin-doc file less openssh pinfo rxvt wget
    EOF</pre>
</li>
<li>
  Run <tt>mksetupini</tt> and create compressed <tt>setup.ini</tt> files for the
  setup program:
  <pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    cd /var/www/custom-cygwin/
    for ARCH in x86 x86_64 ; do
      mksetupini --arch ${ARCH} --inifile=${ARCH}/setup.ini --releasearea=.
      bzip2 &lt;${ARCH}/setup.ini &gt;${ARCH}/setup.bz2
      xz -6e &lt;${ARCH}/setup.ini &gt;${ARCH}/setup.xz
    done</pre>
  You will see error messages from <tt>mksetupini</tt> about non-existent
  packages if you do not have a full mirror (or if you made an error
  in a <tt>.hint</tt> file).
</li>
<li>
  Test your mirror with the Cygwin setup program!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>
  TBD: Discuss the need to sign <tt>setup.ini</tt> files and provide the key
  used with setup's -K option, or use setup's -X option.
</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>
  TBD: The setup-version: line from the mirror should be perpetuated into
  the generated <tt>setup.ini</tt>.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Historical note on <tt>genini</tt></h2>

<p>
<tt>genini</tt> is a script previously used to create <tt>setup.ini</tt> files.
This can no longer be used as it does not currently support Cygwin packages with
<tt>pvr.hint</tt> files.
</p>

<p>
You can download <tt>genini</tt> from the
<a href="https://cygwin.com/git/?p=cygwin-apps/calm.git">Cygwin-apps git</a>.
</p>

<p>
<tt>genini</tt> also requires the <tt>Archive::Perl</tt> module which you can
install via CPAN, or with <tt>apt-get install libarchive-tar-perl</tt> or
equivalent.
